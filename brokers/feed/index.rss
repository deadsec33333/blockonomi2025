<h2>How Is ATFX Regulated?</h2>
<p>Since ATFX has its headquarters in the United Kingdom, it is regulated by the FCA. The official name of ATFX is AT Global Markets (UK) Limited. The Financial Conduct Authority regulates and authorizes this company. The FCA registration number is 7605555 and the company number is 09827091.</p>
<p>The regulation and authorization from the FCA are for ATFX to be a CFD and FX broker. The FCA CASS rules authorize ATFX to hold client funds. As part of its FCA regulation and authorization, ATFX follows the agency’s strict regulatory requirements. These include the fair treatment of clients and the protection of client money.</p>
<p>ATFX is also regulated in the Middle East and North America.</p>
<p>Additionally, ATFX Global Markets (CY) Ltd. operates from Limassol, Cyprus. As such, this section of ATFX is under regulation from CySEC, the Cyprus Securities and Exchanges Commission. CySEC regulation provides access to the EU and EEA countries. Switzerland and the Middle East also have access to ATFX via CySEC regulation.</p>
<h2>ATFX Country Restrictions</h2>
<p>ATFX is a global brokerage overall. That being said, it is not available to clients in certain countries of the world. These include Yemen, Vanuatu, Tunisia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Sri Lanka. It also includes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq, Ethiopia, Syria, Sudan, DPRK, and Turkey. ATFX cannot be used in Cuba, Japan, Iran, Canada, or the USA either. It is best to confirm that ATFX is available in your country if it is not explicitly stated. You can do this by contacting ATFX directly.</p>
<h2>MiFID</h2>
<p>In addition to the regulation, ATFX complies with MiFID, the Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments. The European Parliament and Council adopted this on Nov. 1, 2007. MiFID regulates financial instrument markets for providing investment services as well as activities, specifically in the European Economic Area. This EEA includes all 27 member states of the EU in addition to Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland.</p>
<p>The goal of MiFID was to harmonize financial market governance in the EEA. It also aims to improve financial transparency, efficiency, competition, and consumer protection. With MiFID, investment firms are able to freely offer services within other member state’s territories or those of third parties. The only requirement is that the investment firm must have authorization for those services.</p>
<p>As part of its transparency, ATFX has a range of legal documents available on its website. This includes all documents related to compliance and regulation. Each is downloadable for convenience. They span categories such as general, CFDs, and spread betting. This is where to go for details on terms and conditions related to specific services and products.</p>
<h2>Edge Accounts</h2>
<p>ATFX <a href="/out/atfx">offers an Edge Account</a> that has better spreads and faster speeds. It is designed for advanced traders and also includes additional latency reduction.</p>
<p>This type of account has a minimum deposit of $5,000. It includes spreads starting at 0.6 pips and $0 commission per lot. There is a stop-out at 50 percent. Edge Accounts have market (STP) execution and maximum leverage for retail clients of 30:1. There are no requotes nor rejection. This account has Negative Balance Protection for retail clients. It also has slippage and allows both hedging and Expert Advisors.</p>
<p><a href="/out/atfx"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24458 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/edge-account.jpg" alt="Edge Account" width="808" height="381" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/edge-account.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/edge-account-300x141.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/edge-account-768x362.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/edge-account-50x24.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/edge-account-610x288.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></a></p>

<h2>ATFX Professional Clients</h2>
<p><a href="/out/atfx">Professional client</a> classification is also available from ATFX. Professional clients do not have to deal with the margin increases from the ESMA changes in 2018. The European Securities and Markets Authority restricted certain products for retail clients starting Aug. 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Professional clients also have access to leverage of up to 200:1. There are no changes to tax status or requirements of products. Nor are there changes to client money protection.</p>
<p><a href="/out/atfx"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24459 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/professional-client.jpg" alt="Professional Client" width="808" height="337" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/professional-client.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/professional-client-300x125.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/professional-client-768x320.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/professional-client-50x21.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/professional-client-610x254.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></a></p>
<p>Professional clients do waive some FCA protections. These include a lack of negative balance protection and waived restrictions on CFDs. ATFX can also use sophisticated market language when talking to professional clients and assume higher experience levels. There are also changes to considerations for best execution. For retail clients, priorities are the transaction cost and the overall price. For professional clients, speed and execution likelihood also play a role.</p>
<h2>Demo Account</h2>
<p><a href="/out/atfx">ATFX does have a demo account</a>. This is a great way to get a feel for the offerings of the broker. It can also be a useful tool for beginner traders who need to hone their skills. Or advanced traders can use the demo account to test new strategies.</p>
<p><a href="/out/atfx"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24460 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/demo-account.jpg" alt="Demo Account" width="808" height="585" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/demo-account.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/demo-account-300x217.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/demo-account-768x556.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/demo-account-50x36.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/demo-account-610x442.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></a></p>
<h2>ATFX Deposits</h2>
<p>There are <a href="/out/atfx">three main deposit methods</a> available on ATFX: credit or debit cards, bank transfers, and e-wallets. E-wallets include Safecharge, Neteller, and Skrill. All three methods support deposits in EUR, USD, or GBP. There are no fees for any deposits charged by ATFX. In the case of debit or credit cards from outside the UK, your provider may charge a small processing fee. ATFX will reimburse you for this fee if you provide a receipt to prove the charges. Deposits made with credit cards, debit cards, or e-wallets typically appear within 30 minutes. Bank transfers will appear in your trading account within a working day after ATFX receives the funds.</p>
<h2>ATFX Withdrawals</h2>
<p>ATFX offers the same withdrawal methods as deposit methods: credit or debit card, e-wallet, or bank transfer. As with deposits, there are no fees charged by ATFX and you can withdraw in EUR, USD, or GBP. Most withdrawals are processed within a working day, but ATFX is not liable for delays. Most withdrawals requests that ATFX receives before 2 p.m. (in the UK) get processed that day.</p>
<p>Following processing, funds will usually clear between 1 and 3 working days. International bank wires typically require 3 to 5 more working days to appear in your account, depending on the bank. Withdrawals via e-wallets will typically arrive within 2 days. Refunds to debit and credit cards typically finish processing in 2 to 5 days.</p>
<p>Remember that for compliance reasons, withdrawals must be returned to your original payment source. In the case of profits on trades from deposits made with a card, the extra funds will go to a bank account. You must also fully verify your ATFX account before you can withdraw funds.</p>

<h2>Orders Types</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, ATFX offers market order execution. Market orders are sent to the market, then executed at the market’s tradeable price. Following execution, the information regarding the transaction will go to the MT4 platform. The execution price for market orders is influenced by the amount of liquidity from banks and if it is enough. It can change rapidly. Remember that the MT4 platform will send the transaction instructions to the given MT4 server.</p>
<p>ATFX offers a range of order types to choose from. Pending order options include Buy Limit, Buy Stop, Sell Stop, and Sell Limit. A Take Profit or Stop Less closes pending orders. All pending orders connect to company instructions within the server. The pending order is triggered, then transacted and executed in the form of a market order.

This will display the icon by the menu bar. Click on the Fibonacci Retracement, crosshair, or trend line for even more options.</p>
<h2>Trading Central</h2>
<p>Trading Central is known for its top-tier technical analysis resources. ATFX clients get access to Trading Central features, helping with the full array of investment strategies. Trading Central is well-respected worldwide, conducting research for over 200 investment banks, professional dealers, brokers, and fund managers. It is used in 45 different countries. All ATFX clients get free access to Trading Central.</p>
<p>The Trading Central access provides professional data analysis and technical strategies for a range of assets. These include indices, precious metals, currencies, and commodities. Strategies are updated ten times every day for each product for up-to-date information.</p>
<p>To give traders confidence in the Trading Central information, it is part of three different associations for Independent Research Providers.

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24464 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trading-central.jpg" alt="Trading Central" width="808" height="585" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trading-central.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trading-central-300x217.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trading-central-768x556.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trading-central-50x36.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trading-central-610x442.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>The research displayed in Trading Central utilizes chartist analysis to determine targets and price direction. It also includes mathematical models to determine timing relevance and confirm directions.

<p>Trading Central also includes advanced features such as adaptive candlesticks that recognize candlestick patterns in real-time continuation and reversal.

<p>To take advantage of Trading Central, you just download the installation package. There is also an installation guide if you need assistance.</p>
<h2>Economic Calendar</h2>
<p>As expected from a broker, ATFX does indeed <a href="/out/atfx">have an economic calendar</a>. The broker refers to it as a “live forex news calendar.” The calendar is automatically updated so traders can have the latest information. It also includes the ability to check past events in the history. For each event on the calendar, you will see the time, currency, importance, event, actual, forecast, and previous figures.</p>
<p>You can change the time zone or the dates you wish to view. There are also filters, including for country, time, importance, and category. Category includes options such as central banks, balance, economic activity, inflation, bonds, and more. Or you can search for a specific event by name by clicking on the Filters.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24465 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/economic-calendar.jpg" alt="Economic Calendar" width="808" height="585" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/economic-calendar.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/economic-calendar-300x217.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/economic-calendar-768x556.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/economic-calendar-50x36.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/economic-calendar-610x442.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>ATFX has a full section dedicated to technical analysis. This includes market news and analysis for popular products such as oil, precious metals, indices, gold, crypto, and FX majors. Technical Analysis is posted several times a week. Updates focus on specific products and include predictions, influences, and more.</p>
<h2>Expert Analysis</h2>
<p>To help traders make educated decisions, ATFX has a daily market report. This includes the latest overviews for sentiments and technical elements. The report has sentiment figures related to both small and large players. It also includes the main strategies and technical for traders, whether they are contrarian or conformist.</p>
<p>This is a daily market report and you can download it right from the ATFX website. Past market reports are also available on the same page, including those from the last few months.</p>
<p>The market reports are created by a third party. ATFX does not take any responsibility for the completeness or accuracy of the reports. Even so, the inclusion of the reports for ATFX clients is an incredibly useful tool. It can lead to a great deal of time savings in research or supplement a client’s other research strategies.</p>
<p>In addition to the daily market reports, ATFX also offers Fundamental Commentary. This comes from the Market Analysis Research Team. It includes detailed, updated fundamental commentary. You will find articles related to fundamental moves, upcoming events in the economic calendar, and advanced economic indicators. These Fundamental Market Commentaries are weekly. They are also available for download in the Analysis section of ATFX. They include a number of older reports so you can view historic information. As with the market reports, the Fundamental Commentary is from a third-party and ATFX does not take responsibility for accuracy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24466 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/technical-analysis.jpg" alt="Technical Analysis" width="808" height="585" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/technical-analysis.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/technical-analysis-300x217.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/technical-analysis-768x556.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/technical-analysis-50x36.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/technical-analysis-610x442.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p><a href="/out/atfx">The education section</a> on ATFX focuses on webinars. You will not find e-books or the vast range of resources that many other brokers offer. There are, however, more webinars available from ATFX than many competitors offer. The webinars are free to ATFX clients but do require registration.</p>
<p>The range of webinars helps clients develop trading skills or grow understanding of concepts. There are webinars for all skill levels, from professional traders to beginners. They are always run by professionals to provide a high level of accurate information.</p>
<p>The list of webinars always includes the title, language, date, start time, and duration. You can also read a description of the webinar to help you decide if you want to register. The webinars include regular ATFX Daily Market Updates several times a week in English. You can also find webinars in Italian, German, Spanish, and other languages. In addition to the market updates, webinars can focus on useful trading skills as well, such as trading using RSI and moving averages or Fibonacci trading.</p>
<h2>VPS Services</h2>
<p>Depending on the type of account you have, it is also possible to use a VPS via ATFX. The use of a virtual private server leads to more secure execution of Expert Advisors. That execution tends to be quicker with a VPS and more reliable.</p>

<h2>ATFX Affiliate Program</h2>
<p>The <a href="/out/atfx">ATFX Affiliate Program</a> is designed to help clients grow their forex business. It includes transparent reporting with plenty of details plus competitive commissions and exceptional customer service. To make use of the affiliate program, you just register to be an ATFX Partner. Your website will be approved and you can get started. Take a look at the various ATFX marketing materials so you can increase your conversions. For every client you introduce, you earn a CPA commission. You receive the commission once the client meets a minimum trading threshold.</p>
<p>There is also an Introducing Broker Partnership Program. This allows partners to earn rebates for clients they refer. There is no concern about complexities during the integration process into ATFX. You also do not need to make any up-front investment. As an Introducing Broker, you just introduce the client. ATFX takes it from there and you earn a rebate. There are no limits on the commissions per client.</p>
<p>The rebate options are customizable and competitive. There is also a Multi-level Commission Payout mechanism. This means that every ATFX client referral case leads to gains. Every closed deal from your referral leads to a commission. You can also get earnings from sub-IB referrals. Commission payments are instant without hidden charges or fees.</p>
<p>Partners also receive 24/5 live support from an assigned Account Manager. This support is multilingual. IBs even receive training to help them maximize profits. There are guides from experts depending on plans, business goals, and your competitive advantages. IBs also receive free access to Trading Central and other trading tools.</p>
<h2>ATFX Awards</h2>
<p>Over the years, ATFX has earned numerous awards across various markets. It was named the Best NDD Forex Broker 2018 from the Online Personal Wealth AwardsMoneyAM. ATFX was also honored with Best Forex Customer Services 2017 at the Entrepreneur JFEX Awards and 13th Jordan Forex Expo. It was named the Top Forex Broker 2017 by Third Session of Chinese Foreign Exchange Brokers Annual Conference HT Financial. ATFX was also the Best Branded Broker 2017 from Shenzhen Huiyu Financial. It was also the Best Forex Broker 2017 at Tapei International FinanceWord Forum FinanceWord.</p>
<p>The Global Banking &amp; Finance Awards 2018 also named ATFX the FX Broker of the Year, UK. This is an addition to the Best Forex CFDs Broker title from the UK Forex Awards of Share Magazine. In 2017, the broker was the Fastest Growing Forex Broker, Europe 2017.</p>
<h2>How Does ATFX Protect Client Funds?</h2>
<p>ATFX has a strong commitment to ensuring that client funds remain safe at all times. The company uses the latest encryption technology currently available to protect data. This is combined with effective protection measures and strict supervision. The result is a trading environment that is safe and reliable.</p>
<p>Additionally, ATFX segregates client funds in trust accounts. Its custodian bank is Barclays Bank PLC. Holding client funds in segregated accounts ensures the funds are always separate from those of ATFX. Furthermore, if something happens to ATFX and it becomes insolvent, your funds are safe. Since they are segregated, they cannot be used to reimburse creditors.</p>
<p>To add to the protections in the unlikely event of insolvency, AT Global Markets (UK) Limited clients have FSCS coverage. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme is available to clients in organizations regulated by the FCA. The scheme comes into play in the rare case that ATFX cannot satisfy its repayment claims. In this situation, the FSCS provides as much as £50,000 in compensation per person for eligible investments.</p>
<p>ATFX also has its own self-developed accounting system which is automatic. It ensures that withdrawals are only possible when the identity of the client matches the information on the account. For further finance transparency, ATFX has partnerships with EY, a professional audit organization.</p>
<h2>How Do You Contact ATFX?</h2>
<p>For the convenience of clients, ATFX offers multiple methods of contacting the team. There are main phone lines available on weekdays between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., UK time. There is an 800 number from the UK and a separate number for calls from outside the UK. Or you can send an email to the relevant department. The Contact Us section of the ATFX website lists all. Email addresses are for general information, complaints/disputes, partnerships, support, and sales inquiries. You can also contact support via live chat in the bottom right corner of the page.</p>
<h2>ATFX Help Center</h2>
<p>One area in which ATFX is lacking is a help center. Most brokers have an obvious help center or section with FAQs. There is no such obvious section of the ATFX website. Instead, there are webinars and there is ready information for contacting customer support. There are some sections with FAQs, such as those related to trading. Overall, however, there is no convenient way to find information on other FAQs. It would be nice to have a dedicated section for information such as this. It would make it easier to open an account, fund the account, and do basic troubleshooting without contacting ATFX.</p>
<h2>ATFX Complaints</h2>
<p>Since ATFX is a regulated firm, it has a clear complaint-handling procedure. Any complaint is handled thoroughly. This includes a full response as well as an explanation. The staff at ATFX all undergo complaint-handling training. In most cases, ATFX is able to resolve complaints early on.</p>
<p>In the rare case of an unresolved complaint, clients can sometimes refer to the FOS. This independent body has the purpose of investigating complaints made against regulated firms. The FOS will investigate your complaint and deliver a response. For the best results and least hassle, ATFX suggests only contacting the FOS following a final response from ATFX.</p>
<h2>ATFX Sponsorships</h2>
<p>To be involved in the community, ATFX sponsors some events. This includes The Duke of Edinburgh Cup, the China Event 2018. ATFX chose to sponsor this particular event since it began in the UK and is promoted in regions worldwide. Additionally, the Duke of Edinburgh Cup is a known charity that has Royal Patronage. The charity helps young people around the world. This lines up with the philosophy of ATFX, which further encouraged the broker to sponsor the event. This particular event is long-standing, with 18 years of events. Over 20 countries from five continents have participated and there have been over 134 tournaments.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><a href="/out/atfx">ATFX</a> is a broker with its headquarters in the United Kingdom, specifically London. This broker offers trading for a range of assets, including forex, CFDs, and commodities. There are several types of accounts available, including for Professional Clients.</p>
<p>ATFX offers competitive spreads and has no commissions.</p>
<p>Trading is done via MetaTrader 4 with support for all devices, both mobile and desktop. Customer service is available 24/5. The range of deposit and withdrawal methods offers something for most traders.</p>
<p>If you are based in the UK, the <a href="https://blockonomi.com/bitcoin-spread-betting/">spread betting</a> option might be attractive to you as this method of trading is capital gains tax-free.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="infobutton" href="/out/atfx">Visit ATFX</a></p>

<h2>XM Overview<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The broker <a href="/out/xm">offers an advanced trading platform</a> as well as flexible trading conditions to accommodate a range of global clients. XM’s expertise comes from in-depth knowledge of and experience with the global financial markets.</p>
<p>The broker is dedicated to offering superior services. Those include trading currencies, CFDs, precious metals, energies, and equity indices.</p>
<p>XM also offers its operational philosophy as a reason to consider choosing this company as a broker. Its philosophy is to earn loyalty as a way to ensure the satisfaction of clients. XM recognizes that credibility and reputation are closely linked.</p>
<p><a href="/out/xm"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26006 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/xm-features.jpg" alt="" width="808" height="659" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/xm-features.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/xm-features-300x245.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/xm-features-768x626.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/xm-features-50x41.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/xm-features-610x498.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></a></p>
<p>XM also takes steps to adapt to changing client needs as they become more demanding and sophisticated. This is done by monitoring industry trends and technologies. XM is proud to have never compromised on factors impacting client performance. This directly leads to the broker’s ability to deliver the best execution and tight spreads.</p>
<p>One of the important characteristics of XM is the company’s strive to remain human and connect with clients. This is why management has visited more than 120 cities worldwide to meet with clients as well as partners. XM feels that human interactions have a high value and always aims to deliver those interactions.</p>
<p>XM strives to offer a range of learning opportunities for traders of all skill levels. Part of this is hosting seminars around the world. The goal is to give traders the skills needed to make improved trading decisions. XM has already hosted hundreds of these seminars, with even more planned.</p>

<hr />
<h2>What Types of Accounts Does XM Offer?</h2>
<p>XM lets clients choose from <a href="/out/xm">four main types of accounts</a>: Micro, Standard, XM Ultra Low, and Shares Accounts. All account types have exceptional trading conditions and unlimited access to MT4/MT4 with EA trading.</p>
<p>XM also offers the ability to trade standard or micro lots, and the same execution quality across account types. There are free and regular intra-day market updates plus technical analysis. There is also multilingual customer support plus Personal Account Managers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26007 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/account-types-1.jpg" alt="Account Types" width="808" height="659" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/account-types-1.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/account-types-1-300x245.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/account-types-1-768x626.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/account-types-1-50x41.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/account-types-1-610x498.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<hr />
<h2>Micro and Standard Accounts</h2>
<p><a href="/out/xm">Micro Accounts</a> can have the base currency of USD, GBP, EUR, CHF, JPY, AUD, PLN, HUF, RUB, ZAR, or SGD. 1 lot is 1,000 and there are no commissions. This type of account has negative balance protection, trading bonuses, and no deposit bonuses.</p>
<p>An Islamic account is optional and the minimum deposit is $5. Hedging is allowed. Trading on MT4 must meet the trade volume minimum of 0.01 lots, which is 0.1 lots on MT5. These clients can only have up to 200 positions open or pending at a time. There is a limit of 100 lots per ticket.</p>
<p>The main difference for Standard Accounts with XM is that 1 lot is 100,000. There is a restriction of 50 lots per ticket and the minimum trade volume is 0.01 lots. Other than this, the Standard and Micro Accounts are essentially identical.</p>
<hr />
<h2>XM Ultra Low Account</h2>
<p><a href="/out/xm">An XM Ultra Low Account</a> is available with the base currency of USD, GBP, EUR, SGD, AUD, or ZAD. You still have no commissions and negative balance protection. Islamic Accounts remain optional. There are no trading bonuses and no deposit bonuses, plus hedging is allowed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum deposit is $5. There is still a maximum of 200 open or pending positions.</li>
<li>XM Ultra Low Accounts can be Standard Ultra or Micro Ultra.</li>
<li>For Standard Ultra, minimum trade volume is 0.01 lots and there is a limit of 50 lots per ticket.</li>
<li>For Micro Ultra, these figures are 0.1 lots and 100 lots, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>What Other Accounts Does XM Offer?</h2>
<p>Shares Accounts are always Islamic and have a minimum deposit of $10,000. There are no trading bonuses, no deposit bonuses, and hedging is not allowed.</p>
<p>The contract size is 1 share with a minimum trade volume of 1 lot. Clients can have a maximum of 50 positions open and pending, and the lot restriction per ticket depends on the share.</p>
<p>XM can also help clients create custom-tailored accounts for trading forex. This allows flexibility to meet the needs of any client.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Islamic Accounts</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, most of the account types available on XM are offered as Islamic accounts. Islamic or swap-free accounts do not have any rollover or swap interest for overnight positions.</p>
<p>To open an Islamic account, simply open an account normally and then validate it in the Member’s Area. At this point, you just contact XM to change it to an Islamic Account. Keep in mind that XM does reserve the ability to revoke the swap-free status in case of abuse.</p>
<p>Compared to other forex brokers who offer Islamic accounts, XM’s offerings stand out. That is because most brokers will give Islamic accounts higher spreads. XM, however, does not apply additional charges on Islamic Accounts.</p>
<p>Additionally, XM remains respectful to the idea of Islamic Accounts, never using “swap-free in disguise” accounts. Some brokers use this type of account, in which they transfer the interest charge to a different fee. As this would still be a charge covering interest, it goes against ethical and fair trading.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What Assets Can You Trade With XM?</h2>
<p>XM gives clients the ability to <a href="/out/xm">trade more than 1,000 instruments</a> across 9 asset classes:</p>

</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26008 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/trading-instruments.jpg" alt="Trading Instruments" width="808" height="659" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/trading-instruments.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/trading-instruments-300x245.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/trading-instruments-768x626.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/trading-instruments-50x41.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/trading-instruments-610x498.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>XM offers access to eight commodities via futures CFDs. There is access to 18 cash indices CFDs and 12 futures indices CFDs. XM also lets clients trade two spot metals instruments, gold and silver. Finally, there are five futures CFDs of energies.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Leverage and Margin at XM</h2>
<p>XM offers leverage from 2:1 up to 30:1 depending on the instrument traded. Higher leverage allows traders to open larger positions with less capital, but also increases risk.</p>
<p>Margin refers to the amount that must be deposited to open a position. For forex, gold, and silver, new positions can be opened if the margin requirement is less than or equal to the free margin (available funds) in the account. For other instruments, margin requirements are stricter.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26009" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/leverage.jpg" alt="Leverage" width="808" height="531" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/leverage.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/leverage-300x197.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/leverage-768x505.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/leverage-50x33.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/leverage-610x401.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<h3>Margin Requirements</h3>
<p>Margin requirements are calculated separately for each position and adapt based on the account leverage and symbol leverage, whichever is lower, as shown in this example:</p>
<p>Margin Requirement = [Lots * Contract Size * Open Price] / [Lower of (Account Leverage, Symbol Leverage)]
<p>So if account leverage is 200:1 but symbol leverage is only 100:1, the lower 100:1 leverage would be used to calculate margin.</p>
<h3>Risks of Leverage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Leverage allows trading larger positions with less capital</li>
<li>Losses can also become much larger with high leverage</li>
<li>Leverage over 30:1 is very risky and not recommended</li>
</ul>
<p>To manage risk, XM provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time monitoring of used and free margin</li>
<li>Margin call warnings if equity drops too low</li>
<li>Automatic closing of positions if equity falls below 50% of required margin (stop-out level)</li>
</ul>
<p>XM offers high leverage but also tools to monitor risk exposure. Traders should use leverage judiciously based on their risk tolerance.</p>
<hr />
<h2>XM Spreads</h2>
<p>It is important to note that XM uses variable spreads, as does the interbank forex market. By offering variable spreads, XM is able to eliminate the need for an insurance premium. That would be necessary for fixed spreads since they tend to be higher than the variable spreads.</p>
<p>This is further hampered by the fact that many brokers restrict trading close to news announcements. As such, the required insurance premium becomes worthless.</p>
<p>By offering variable spreads, XM is able to avoid these issues for traders. There are also no restrictions related to trading at the time of news releases.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26010 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spreads.jpg" alt="Spreads" width="808" height="531" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spreads.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spreads-300x197.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spreads-768x505.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spreads-50x33.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spreads-610x401.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>XM also gives clients access to fractional pip pricing. This allows for the best prices from the XM liquidity providers.</p>
<p>Essentially, a 5th digit can be added to the typical 4-digit price quotes. This lets clients take advantage of even tiny price movements. It also allows for the most accurate quoting and tighter spreads.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What Should You Know About Overnight Positions With XM?</h2>
<p>For overnight positions, XM prides itself on offering competitive and transparent swap rates. The rollover policy is that XM will credit or debit client accounts and take care of rollover interest.</p>
<p>This applies to any position held open following 22:00 GMT. It is important to note that rollovers do not take place during Saturdays and Sundays since the markets are closed.</p>
<p>Despite this, banks will calculate interest on positions held during the weekend. As such, XM applies 3-day rollover strategies on Wednesday.</p>

<hr />
<h2>How Do You Place an Order With XM?</h2>
<p>XM allows you to place a range of order types. These include trailing stops, stops, limits, and market orders. Place the trade at any time of the day, provided that it is during trading hours. There is also the ability to place trades via the telephone for those who prefer this method.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What Are the Trading Hours?</h2>
<p>The trading hours on XM are those of the market. For the forex market, one market will close when another opens thanks to markets in New York, Sydney, Tokyo, and London.</p>
<p>This allows for 24/5 trading on the forex market. The XM trading hours are from Sunday at 22:05 GMT to Friday at 21:50 GMT. This applies to phone trading.</p>
<p>If you use the trading platform outside of these hours, trades will not execute. Instead, you can only view the relevant features.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26012 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/trading-hours.jpg" alt="Trading Hours" width="808" height="531" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/trading-hours.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/trading-hours-300x197.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/trading-hours-768x505.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/trading-hours-50x33.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/trading-hours-610x401.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<hr />
<h2>What Is the XM Execution Policy?</h2>
<p>With XM, clients can trade with real-time execution and no requotes. Since the policy began in 2010, XM has had no rejection of orders and no requotes at all. 100 percent of orders are executed, with an impressive 99.35 percent executed within a second.</p>
<p>You can place orders on the XM-supported platforms at any time during the trading hours. Positions stay open until your closing trade gets executed. The balance of your account will be updated in real time to reflect the current market prices. Just keep in mind that there is a maximum of 200 positions that can be opened at a time. This includes pending orders and is per client.</p>
<p>XM offers fractional pip pricing that makes it possible to trade using tighter spreads. It also allows for the most accurate quoting possible.</p>
<p>Fills for market orders occur with a simple click. Market orders can be filled with up to 50 lots (or 5 million). Those who want to trade even larger quantities with market orders have two options. You can place the trade by phone or divide the order into several smaller ones.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26013 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/execution-policy.jpg" alt="Execution Policy" width="808" height="531" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/execution-policy.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/execution-policy-300x197.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/execution-policy-768x505.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/execution-policy-50x33.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/execution-policy-610x401.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>Fills for limit and stop-loss orders are guaranteed with up to 50 lots. These occur at the market price that is the best available. This policy allows clients to manage their risk.</p>
<p>There is a clear policy for market gaps between Friday close and the Sunday opening. This can include holidays and weekends. XM will execute the pending stop and limit orders at the first market price available for the position size.</p>
<p>Even in cases of illiquidity and volatility, XM has a competitive policy. XM partners with numerous liquidity providers to significantly limit the risk of illiquidity. In volatile market conditions, XM will execute orders at the market price that is the best available.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What Trading Platforms Can You Use With XM?</h2>
<p>Clients of XM <a href="/out/xm">have access</a> to either MT4 or MT5, both of which are popular MetaTrader platforms. They are available across devices and you can trade via the XM WebTrader in the browser.</p>
<p>Despite the popularity and prevalence of the <a href="https://moneycheck.com/free-trading-platforms-compared/">MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 platforms</a>, XM stands out. XM was a pioneer in offering an MT4 platform that focuses on trading execution quality. Trading on MT4 with XM gives you access to leverage between 1:1 and 1:1000. There are also no rejections or requotes.</p>
<h3>MetaTrader 4</h3>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26015 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/metatrader4-1.jpg" alt="Meta Trader 4" width="808" height="531" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/metatrader4-1.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/metatrader4-1-300x197.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/metatrader4-1-768x505.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/metatrader4-1-50x33.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/metatrader4-1-610x401.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>Additionally, there are built-in help guides for MT4 as well as Metaquotes Language 4. The platform can handle a wide range of orders. It also allows for the creation of custom indicators as well as time periods.</p>
<p>You can use MetaTrader 4 to manage your trade history in the database, including importing and exporting. There is also an internal mailing system and a guarantee of full security and backup.</p>
<p>MetaTrader 4 is available for PC, Mac, iPad, iPhone, Android, Android Tablet, and as the WebTrader. All versions have similar functionality and allow for working on one device and then switching to another.</p>
<h3>MT4 Multiterminal</h3>
<p>Although MT4 Multiterminal is technically a variation of MT4 for XM, it has additional functionality. This platform is specifically designed to let traders handle more than one MT4 accounts from a single terminal.</p>
<p>Using MT4 Multiterminal gives you a single login and password to access the accounts. It supports as many as 128 trading accounts.</p>
<p>You still get similar features to other MT4 platforms. MT4 Multiterminal offers three allocation methods, multiple order types, and execution and management in real time.</p>
<h3>MetaTrader 5</h3>
<p>The other major platform available from XM is MetaTrader 5. MT5 builds on the offerings of MT4, adding 1,000 stocks/shares CFDs. As such, it is a great multi-asset platform.</p>
<p>You still get the same flexible leverage and no requotes or rejections. There is a single login for seven separate platforms.</p>
<p>MT5 is available for PC, Mac, iPad, iPhone, Android, and Android Tablets, or as a WebTrader.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26017 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/metatrader5-1.jpg" alt="MetaTrader 5" width="808" height="531" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/metatrader5-1.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/metatrader5-1-300x197.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/metatrader5-1-768x505.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/metatrader5-1-50x33.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/metatrader5-1-610x401.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>

<h2>Research and Education</h2>
<p>XM gives clients access to an extensive Research and Education center. There are daily updates on major trading sessions. There are also daily briefings for critical market events.</p>
<p>Twenty multilingual market professionals man the center to ensure up-to-date information in a range of languages.</p>
<h3>What Type of Research Does XM Offer?</h3>
<p>There are <a href="/out/xm">separate homepages</a> on XM for research and for education. The research section includes highlights and links to the subsections. The right side of the screen shows some of the most common assets and their current spreads and prices. Below this, there is a calendar of webinars.</p>
<p>The Market Preview page features daily previews of the European open. Here, you can find assets to watch and some expert insights. The Stock Market News section is as it sounds, with news related to stocks.</p>
<p>Articles may be news-related when relevant or labeled as technical analysis. There is then a separate page for Forex Previews, also with news and insights. You can also find a separate Technical Analysis page on XM. This page has recent expert technical analysis on a range of crucial assets and their movements.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26019 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/research.jpg" alt="Research" width="808" height="619" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/research.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/research-300x230.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/research-768x588.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/research-50x38.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/research-610x467.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>The Special Reports page has more in-depth articles, but they are posted less frequently. The previously mentioned pages have new articles nearly every day, if not more often. By contrast, there are Special Reports posted a handful of times each month, when the need arises.</p>

<h2>Pepperstone’s History</h2>
<p>A veteran management team founded the company in 2010, putting years of experience in technology and forex to good use. The team decided to create Pepperstone after noticing that traders became increasingly frustrated when using online-based forex firms with trade execution delays, poor customer support, and excessive spreads.</p>
<p>From the start, Pepperstone aimed to overcome this via its superior technology, exceptional customer service, low-cost spreads, and low-latency execution.</p>
<p>The management team members behind the company has vast experience within the industry, helping them understand the requirements of retail forex traders to effectively trade.</p>
<p>The team does not want to just stay up to date with forex developments; the company wants to constantly improve its services. Pepperstone always aims to create and develop then introduce its own solutions that can enhance the ease of online trading.</p>
<p>At the same time, these solutions make trading more professional and fairer and can aid all clients, regardless of whether they are a large institution or a small retail investor.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18212 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pepperstone-website.jpg" alt="Pepperstone Website" width="808" height="585" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pepperstone-website.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pepperstone-website-300x217.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pepperstone-website-768x556.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pepperstone-website-50x36.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<h2>Vision and Values</h2>
<p>Since its founding, the vision of Pepperstone has been spearheading online forex trading’s evolution in more than 65 countries. Pepperstone hopes to make forex more accessible to individual retail investors.</p>
<p>At the start, the company aimed to start revolutionizing the industry with better service, quicker execution, and lower spreads than existing brokers, something Pepperstone continues to do today.

<p>The key values of Pepperstone include acting responsibly, being flexible and innovative, offering the best possible service, promoting ethics and integrity throughout the industry, and upholding the highest standards for compliance and regulation.</p>
<h2>Pepperstone Trading Instruments<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>One of the main goals of Pepperstone is to make forex trading more accessible to retail traders. As such, it should come as no surprise that Pepperstone offers many forex instruments for trading.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18213 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/trading-instruments.jpg" alt="Trading Instruments" width="808" height="681" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/trading-instruments.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/trading-instruments-300x253.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/trading-instruments-768x647.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/trading-instruments-50x42.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>

There are six precious metal pairs available, including gold, platinum, silver, and palladium against the USD or EUR. These assets often move along with inflation and market cycles.</p>
<p>Energy trading also has no commission, minimum trade sizes, and flexible leverage. You will find both major oil markets, Brent Crude Oil and West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil, as well as natural gas and more. All trading instruments have a minimum trade size starting at 10c per pip, and you can get leverage of up to 500:1.</p>
<p>Soft commodities are another choice for diversifying your portfolio with Pepperstone since the prices depend on moving and delivering physical assets. Soft commodities that are tradeable with Pepperstone include coffee, sugar, cocoa, cotton, and orange juice, each of which has a 2 percent used margin per one lot.</p>

These trading instruments offer leverage of up to 5:1 across the trading platforms and make it possible to invest in crypto without having to actually buy them or keep a cryptocurrency wallet. Additionally, cryptocurrency trading with Pepperstone lets you hedge on a single account.</p>
<h2>Trading CFDs with Pepperstone</h2>
<p>Pepperstone has CFD technology that is ideal for executing large CFD orders while minimizing slippage. This way, the broker can give clients the best trading experience possible. Pepperstone also has a deep pool with liquidity sources without execution manipulation or a dealing desk, allowing for ultra-low latency.</p>
<p>The CFD technology was specifically designed to support the trade flows of institutions, which gives clients a robust, scalable solution they can count on.</p>
<p>The method from Pepperstone includes handling multiple fills, so it can sweep large orders through several levels into its Liquidity Aggregator. Additionally, Pepperstone systematically executes clients’ CFD orders with a market execution basis that does not require requotes and enables both negative and positive slippage.</p>
<p>Trading CFDs with Pepperstone can be done directly with the MetaTrader 4 or cTrader client terminals so there is no need to have multiple trading accounts.</p>

<h2>Pepperstone Customer Support</h2>
<p>You can contact Pepperstone customer support via live chat on any page of the website. You can also find the broker’s phone number at the bottom of any page or click “Contact Us” at the top of any page. That will show you the broker’s physical address, 24-hour online support options (email and live chat), and numbers for 24-hour phone support.</p>
<h2>Pepperstone Spreads &amp; Fees<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>You can view the current spreads at any time via the Pepperstone website on the Spreads page within the section for “Forex Trading.” This is also where you will find more detailed information about commissions, when applicable. To view the swap rates, right-click on “Market Watch” from the MT4 trading platform and choose “symbols.” Select your currency pair and then “Properties.”</p>
<h2>Funding Your Account<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>You can choose among various base currencies. The base currency is the currency of your account as well as the one you use for deposits. Options include the Australian dollar (AUD), British pound sterling (GBP), United States dollar (USD), euro (EUR), Japanese yen (JPY), Canadian dollar (CAD), New Zealand dollar (NZD), Singapore dollar (SGD), Hong Kong dollar (HKD), and Swiss franc (CHF).</p>
<p>There is an extensive list of funding methods for Pepperstone accounts, including e-wallets and credit and debit cards. You can use Verified by Visa, MasterCard Secure Code, Visa or Mastercard, traditional domestic or international bank transfers, PayPal, POLi for an instant bank transfer, China Union Pay, BPay for transfers from Australian banks, Skrill (Moneybookers), Neteller, Qiwi, Fasapay, other local funding methods, and broker-to-broker transfers.</p>
<p>Many of these methods allow for instant funding 24/7, but you should check the specific timeframe for your chosen funding method. Broker-to-broker transfers typically take two to three days.</p>
<p>Pepperstone will not charge you any fees for a deposit or withdrawal. However, your payment provider might charge you a transfer fee or a conversion fee. It is also noteworthy that Pepperstone does not accept third-party payments, meaning that the name on the Pepperstone account must match the name on the account you use to fund. For joint bank accounts, your name must be one of the parties on the account.</p>
<h2>Pepperstone Withdrawals<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>You can only return funds to a bank account that bears the same name as your Pepperstone account, as with deposits, due to the third-party transaction regulations. Know that if you make a credit card withdrawal, you can only use it for the amount you deposited with the credit card; after that, you must choose another method.</p>
<p>If you fund your account with a credit card and then withdraw within 60 days, the withdrawal will have to go back to your same credit card. Withdrawals are processed the same day if Pepperstone receives them before 21:00 GMT (which is 07:00 AEST). Otherwise, you may need to wait until the following day for processing. Bank Wire Transfer withdrawals typically take three to five business days to arrive in your account.</p>
<p>Pepperstone does not charge fees with withdrawals, but your financial institution could. If this happens, Pepperstone will pass the fee onto you in most cases, including in the case of an international telegraphic transfer fee that Pepperstone’s banking institution charges, which is usually about AUD 20. Any suggested time frames for withdrawals from Pepperstone may be lengthened by unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<h2>EDGE Technology</h2>
<p>You will notice that all the Pepperstone accounts have “Edge” in their name. This is because the broker uses the EDGE Environment, which is considered the highest-performing portfolio for forex trading technology enterprise clients who want to reduce speeds and enjoy execution acceleration.</p>
<p>EDGE makes it possible to trade via MetaTrader 4 with an improvement of up to 12 times in execution speed and up to 10 times in latency reduction. There are also extra optical fiber connections with Interbank Servers within New York, allowing for one-click MT4 ordering for an ultra-fast trade placement.</p>
<p>There is also Pepperstone Price Improvement (PPI) Technology that routes FX orders intelligently, so it can deliver the optimal price and detect the market hotspots. The EDGE spreads are tight thanks to the new Dark Pool Liquidity. Overall, the EDGE technology allows for one-click trading, a secure client area, ultra-low spreads, dark pool liquidity, price improvement technology, and more than 70 tradable instruments.</p>
<p>You can also view the Interbank Market Depth to help inform your trading decisions.</p>
<h2>Pepperstone’s Trading Servers<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Pepperstone uses Equinix trading servers to deliver fast trading. This is the broker’s method of staying competitive in the competitive industry of the global electronic financial markets since the electronic trading systems it offers can only work well if the infrastructure is effective.</p>
<p>Because of the need for speed and reliability, Pepperstone chose to partner with Equinix to make a state-of-the-art infrastructure for trading forex just a few miles from New York’s Wall Street. Pepperstone is part of the Equinix Financial eXchange, which is a state-of-the-art network with execution venues, bank trading servers, and sell and buy side firms at the Equinix high-performance data centers.</p>
<p>It is access to this Equinix Financial eXchange that lets Pepperstone deliver low-latency as well as allowing the broker to exchange data directly with customers and strategic partners nearby.</p>
<p>Additionally, Pepperstone has a direct interlink to the multiple providers in Equinix NY4 via Optical Fiber. These direct connections allow for ordered transmissions at higher speeds than conventional internet connections, which leads to reduced latency. Pepperstone also directly connects to the backbone of the global internet.</p>
<h2>Pepperstone’s VPS Hosting Options</h2>
<p>With access to Virtual Private Servers (VPS), forex traders can run their chosen expert advisors or automated algorithmic strategies 24/7 via a Virtual Machine. This reduces downtime from connectivity and technology failures and Pepperstone has two partnerships that give customers access to VPS hosting.</p>
<p>You can get 20 percent off Pepperstone FXVM VPS, which has ultra-low latency times of just one millisecond. FXVM also has multilingual staff available 24/7 and can help with troubleshooting and installing expert advisors.</p>
<p>Or you can get 20 percent off on a customized Pepperstone VPS plan from New York City Servers for low latency. These high-powered servers run 24/7/365, have a low latency stable connection, and feature fast executions with 24/7 customer support.</p>

<p>With its reach in so many different countries, it should come as no surprise that XTB is regulated by numerous supervision authorities from around the world, including CySec, KNF, FCA, and IFSC.

<h2>History of XTB</h2>
<p>XTB <a href="/out/xtb">has a rich history</a> that reaches back to 2002. In 2002, X-Trade was incorporated. With its location in Warsaw, it was, at the time, the very first foreign exchange brokerage house in Poland offering leverage. In 2004, X-Trade merged and became XTB as a way to comply with the updated regulations for the Polish market.</p>
<p>By 2005, XTB was authorized by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) for offering brokerage services across all types of financial products. In 2005, XTB earned the honor of “Best Broker in Europe” from the Money Markets Journal.</p>
<p>In 2006, XTB became part of the Polish National Clearing House and the Warsaw Stock Exchange. In 2007, it opened its first foreign branch, which was located in the Czech Republic. It followed this achievement by also opening offices in Romania, Slovakia, Germany, and Spain in 2008.</p>
<p>X-Trade Brokers rebranded to become XTB Online Trading in 2009. In 2010, XTB opened up new branches in Portugal, France, Italy, and Hungary. These branches included cross-border licensing in Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Bulgaria, Greece, and Belgium. The year 2010 also saw XTB establish subsidiaries in Turkey and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In 2016, XTB signed a deal with Mads Mikkelsen, the award-winning Hollywood actor, to become a brand ambassador. In 2016, XTB was successfully listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The first day that it was a publicly traded company, the shares rose over 4%.</p>
<p><a href="/out/xtb"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22576 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/XTB-Mads-Mikkelsen.jpg" alt="XTB Mads Mikkelsen" width="808" height="521" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/XTB-Mads-Mikkelsen.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/XTB-Mads-Mikkelsen-300x193.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/XTB-Mads-Mikkelsen-768x495.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/XTB-Mads-Mikkelsen-50x32.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/XTB-Mads-Mikkelsen-610x393.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></a></p>
<h2>XTB Account Types</h2>
<p>XTB has <a href="/out/xtb">multiple account types,</a> including a demo account which is super easy to signup for and will allow you to test out the platform with either MetaTrader 4 or the web-based Xstation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demo Accounts</strong> &#8211; There is a Demo Account from XTB that lets you test out the platform without any commitment.</li>
<li><strong>Standard Accounts</strong> &#8211; This account has access to over 1,500 instruments, including forex, commodities, crypto, indices, stock CFDs, and ETF CFDs. This account type has market execution, leverage of up to 1:200, a minimum spread of 0.35, and a minimum order of 0.1. There is negative balance protection and automated trading. Both account setup and management are free for this account type. You can use MT4 or xStation with this type of account.</li>
<li><strong>Pro Accounts</strong> &#8211; have identical access to assets, with a minimum spread of 0.28 and maximum leverage of 1:200. There is free account set up without any management fees, and the minimum order size is 0.1 lot. This account type also works with both xStation and MT4.</li>
<li><strong>Islamic Accounts</strong> &#8211;  are similar to Standard Accounts. The only differences are that they do not offer cryptocurrency trading and are swap-free.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the Standard and Pro Accounts are available to clients in the UK. Both of these types of accounts for UK clients use floating spreads, with Pro Accounts also featuring market execution. This involves paying a small commission in order to reach market levels. A UK Standard Account spreads float with a minimum of 0.9 pips, while Pro Accounts have a minimum spread of 0 pips, which are also floating.</p>

<h2>XTB Account Signup<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>It is incredibly easy to create a trading account with XTB. To get started, <a href="/out/xtb">simply fill out the online form,</a> which you can easily find on the main page or nearly any other page on the XTB website.</p>
<p>While XTB verifies your details, you will get immediate access to the trading platforms. You will likely need to upload additional documents. After your application is approved, you can deposit your funds and begin trading.</p>
<p><a href="/out/xtb"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22560 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-account-signup.jpg" alt="XTB Account Signup" width="808" height="761" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-account-signup.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-account-signup-300x283.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-account-signup-768x723.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-account-signup-50x47.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-account-signup-610x575.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></a></p>
<h2>Account Verification Requirements</h2>
<p>After you <a href="/out/xtb">create an account</a> with XTB, you will need to activate it before you are able to start trading. This activation process is essentially XTB’s verification process, and it involves uploading required documents to prove your identity as well as your address. Specific requirements vary slightly by region but are generally very similar.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, for example, XTB accepts a passport, national identity card, or driver’s license as proof of identity. In the case of the latter two, you must upload an image of both the front and the back of the ID. The proof of address must be from the past three months and must be a full page.</p>
<p>It cannot be an online document. Accepted proof of address (in the UK) includes a bank statement, a utility bill, a phone bill for a landline, or a tax statement or bill. After XTB reviews and accepts your documents it will then officially activate your trading account.</p>
<h2>XTB Spreads &amp; Pips</h2>
<p>With XTB, traders are able to enjoy <a href="/out/xtb">spreads as high as 200:1 or as tight at 0.3 pips</a>. To round it out, clients enjoy market level execution. For full transparency at all times, XTB includes the pip value, swaps, and spread on your deal ticket; this way, there are never any surprises. XTB also uses advanced trading technology that prevents requotes so you can trust that the trade will enjoy smooth execution.</p>
<p>Each instrument type has its own specific trading terms. If you visit the Market Analysis section of the XTB website, you can go to the Price Tables. Here, you will find the current price for each instrument, including figures for bid, ask, spread, and percent change.</p>
<p>Click on “Instrument Specification” below each chart to see the information for all instruments within a category, as this main page only displays around 10 to 15 of each instrument type due to space limitations.</p>
<h2>XTB Deposits</h2>
<p>To deposit funds into your XTB account and begin trading, simply log in and head to “Deposits.” From there, you just choose your trading account as well as the payment method. XTB offers many methods of depositing funds, some of which have additional charges and many of which are free.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you deposit funds into XTB in a currency that is not that of your bank funds, XTB will not pay for the exchange rates. There are also some variations in accepted deposit methods based on location.</p>
<p>Bank transfers are free and accepted in USD. In some cases, your bank may charge a transfer fee, although XTB will not charge you any additional fees. Bank transfers that you make to XTB must come from banks that are registered in your full name, with the name matching that of the XTB account. If this is not the case, you risk wasting time as the funds will return to the original bank account.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22573 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-deposits.jpg" alt="XTB Deposits" width="808" height="491" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-deposits.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-deposits-300x182.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-deposits-768x467.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-deposits-50x30.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-deposits-610x371.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>Deposits can also be made via credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, and Maestro. These deposits can be made in USD; XTB does not assess any additional fee for this transaction.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use one of several e-wallets to deposit funds into XTB. Paysafe, which used to be known as Skrill, comes with a fee equal to 2% of the amount deposited. SafetyPay comes with a 1.5% fee.</p>
<p>Deposit and withdrawal methods vary by region and country for XTB clients. In the UK, for example, you can also make a deposit via PayPal or Neteller, but SafetyPay is not an option. Deposits for UK accounts can be in USD, GBP, or EUR.</p>
<h2>Minimum Deposit<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The initial deposit into an XTB account must be at least £250, $250, or €250. After this initial deposit, there is no minimum size for subsequent deposits.</p>
<h2>XTB Withdrawals</h2>
<p>Withdrawing funds from your XTB account is just as straightforward as making a deposit. Visit your Client Office after logging in and choose the account you want to withdraw from. Next, choose the amount you want to withdraw.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if your account that you want to withdraw the funds from is not in the same currency as your trading account, Pekao will convert the amount at its rate, either at the time the bank receives the payment or at the time of request. As is the case with deposits, you can only make a withdrawal to a bank account bearing your exact, matching name.</p>
<p>When making withdrawals, XTB processes the payments with the SHA model, covering the full cost that the Sending Bank charges. Your bank may charge you an additional fee. If you choose to withdraw less than $100, this will come with an extra $30 commission.</p>

<p><a href="/out/xtb"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22561 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trading-instruments.jpg" alt="XTB Trading Instruments" width="808" height="761" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trading-instruments.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trading-instruments-300x283.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trading-instruments-768x723.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trading-instruments-50x47.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trading-instruments-610x575.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></a></p>
<h2>XTB Fees</h2>
<p>Commissions vary slightly by account type. There is no commission on Standard Accounts for crypto, forex, indices, or commodities, with commissions on other types starting at 0.8% per lot. These are also the commissions (when applicable) for Islamic Accounts.</p>
<p>For Pro Accounts, the commissions on forex, indices, commodities, and cryptocurrencies start at $4 per lot. Commissions for stock CFDs and ETF CFDs start at 0.08% per lot.</p>
<h2>XTB Service Levels</h2>
<p>In addition to account types, XTB offers different service levels. These levels let the broker accommodate the needs of each client, regardless of their experience level or expertise.</p>
<p>Base service levels do not have a minimum volume in lots or a minimum deposit. This service level also provides clients with access to the Premium Educational Materials. The education system was created by XTB specialists and it includes materials for all skill levels to guide you through your trading journey.</p>
<p>Plus service levels have a minimum volume of 10 lots and a minimum deposit of 100 EUR. In addition to providing access to Premium Educational Materials, this service level provides access to Premium Research Materials, Premium Email and Push Notifications, and a priority pass to events, such as Trading Clubs.</p>
<p>The Premium Research Materials come from the XTB award-winning analyst team. They are designed to help you stay up-to-date with the latest market movements and provide expert guidance to support your strategies.</p>
<p><a href="/out/xtb"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-22575 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-service-levels.jpg" alt="XTB Service Levels" width="808" height="685" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-service-levels.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-service-levels-300x254.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-service-levels-768x651.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-service-levels-50x42.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-service-levels-610x517.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></a></p>
<p>The Premium Email and Push Notifications include information like market news, trading signals, and analysis. The idea is to give you quick information that is actionable so you do not miss out on opportunities. The Trading Clubs occur weekly, and professional traders run these sessions to include real-time market analysis. There is also priority access to XTB Masterclasses.</p>
<p>Finally, the VIP service level requires a minimum trade volume of 100 lots and a minimum deposit of 25,000 EUR. In addition to all of the above, this service level gets one-to-one coaching sessions, market analysis on demand, and direct access to market analysis.</p>
<p>Market analysis on demand involves consultations with market analysts who can give you feedback on your trading strategy and explore specific markets for you. This goes hand-in-hand with direct access to market analysts so you can get information on market movements in real-time.</p>
<p>The one-to-one coaching sessions help you improve your technical analysis skills and tools, such as Market Geometry, Ichimoku, and Price Action. These sessions can also help develop trading psychology or risk management. VIPs can contact their Account Manager for a current list of available trainings.</p>
<h2>XTB Trading Platforms</h2>
<p>The Online Personal Wealth Awards named the XTB platform the “Best Trading Platform 2016.” The platform provides clients with live market commentary as well as an economic calendar.

<p>There are two platform choices with XTB: xStation 5 and MetaTrader4.</p>
<h2>xStation</h2>
<p><a href="/out/xtb">xStation 5</a> is the award-winning platform from XTB. It’s simple to use and has superior execution speeds. This platform includes a trading calculator, advanced chart trading, trader statistics, advanced technical analysis, bulk order closing, Trader’s Talk, market sentiment, top movers, and equity screener.</p>
<p>xStation 5 is available for desktop devices, tablets, mobiles, and even smartwatches. The desktop version is fully functional and is the fastest version of the platform.

<p>The mobile version is incredibly popular, with over 50% of XTB clients actively using it. It is filled with powerful tools and features, including complete trade management, the interactive charts, the technical indicators, and bulk order closing. The smartwatch application lets you trade the markets in just a few taps and it works with both Android and iOS smartwatches. The interface is simple to use, and you can trade and manage your orders right from your smartwatch.</p>
<h2>MetaTrader 4</h2>
<p><a href="/out/xtb">MetaTrader 4</a> is the most popular trading platform in the industry, providing XTB clients with all the benefits of a well-loved and easy-to-use platform. There is a vast array of analytical tools built right in as well as the ability to add automatic strategies, indicators, and oscillators.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22563 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/metatrader4.jpg" alt="MetaTrader 4" width="808" height="527" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/metatrader4.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/metatrader4-300x196.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/metatrader4-768x501.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/metatrader4-50x33.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/metatrader4-610x398.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>One special feature of MT4 is the ability to optimize technical trading via powerful pattern recognition. This tool lets you spot trends that are just emerging so you can define the exit and entry points as well as set the profit taking and stop loss levels.</p>
<p>With a one-click dealing system, entering and exiting trades is quick and efficient. MT4 also has a strategy tester and a great deal of experience.</p>
<p>MetaTrader 4 is available for desktop, tablets, and mobile devices. The desktop version is full of features. The tablet version lets you have full control and management over your open transactions. The mobile version is available for both iOS and Android and lets you trade anywhere at any time. It includes intuitive abilities to execute transactions and analyze market trends.</p>
<h2>Order Types</h2>
<p>Those who trade on MetaTrader 4 with their XTB accounts can choosing from Buy Stop, Sell Stop, Sell Limit, and Buy Limit pending orders. There is also the ability to open a trade with an instant order. xStation also lets you make Stop Loss and Take Profit orders to make the most from your trades.</p>
<h2>How Do You Trade with XTB?</h2>
<p>The specific steps to <a href="/out/xtb">trading with XTB</a> will depend on the platform you use. With MetaTrader 4, you can open a trade by using the Market Watch window found along the platform’s left-hand side. Alternately, you can press the F9 button on your keyboard or go to the “tools” tab by the platform’s top menu. After this initial step, just fill in the relevant information for your trade and submit the information.</p>
<p>There are also three methods of placing a trade using xStation, all of which are simple and intuitive. You can do so via the Market Watch window, which opens when you click on the name of a market.</p>
<p>This window features a built-in calculator so you can view things such as commission, pip value, spread in pips and its monetary value, and daily swap points. You can also trade via the chart; specifically, look for the top left-hand corner where you will see buy and sell buttons plus the ability to modify the quantity.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22564 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trading-1.jpg" alt="Trading" width="808" height="679" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trading-1.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trading-1-300x252.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trading-1-768x645.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trading-1-50x42.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/trading-1-610x513.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>Finally, you can opt to use the three-click trade functionality. When on the market you want to trade, select the “Place pending order on Chart” icon. Now, you can click where you want to trade on the chart, followed by where you would like to put the stop loss and then your profit target. This will give you a new deal ticket and you just have to select Buy or Sell.</p>
<h2>XTB Trading Tools</h2>
<p>One unique feature of XTB is that it provides clients with detailed live trader performance statistics. These statistics can be incredibly useful in terms of seeing areas for improvement and areas in which you are doing well.</p>
<p>The broker also offers a Trader’s Calculator that is designed to help you calculate your trade based on your reward and risk. This feature is built into xStation 5 and determines your potential loss or profit based on stop loss, limit order, and lot size. The calculator is designed to assist with risk management.</p>
<p>xStation 5 also includes advanced chart trading, letting you trade right from the charts and take advantage of pending orders, take profits, stop losses, and market orders. xStation 5 also includes advanced technical analysis via technical indicators such as RS, Moving Averages, Fibonacci Retracement, and others.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22570 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-charts.jpg" alt="XTB Charts" width="808" height="589" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-charts.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-charts-300x219.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-charts-768x560.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-charts-50x36.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xtb-charts-610x445.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>The bulk order closing trading tool lets you use a single click to close all losing or winning trades, limiting losses or locking in profits. The equity screener on xStation 5 lets you filter out stocks via an advanced screener to make it easier to find the best trading opportunities.</p>
<p>Those who trade with MetaTrader 4 get access to the Strategy Tester. This lets you test and optimize your EAs. Thanks to this trading tool, you can back test every strategy across your intervals and market assets to discover which solution works best. The results from Strategy Tester are extensive and divided into three tabs for thoroughness.</p>
<p>If you use MetaTrader 4, you will also have access to the MQL programming language, which lets you program and edit technical analysis tools. If you prefer not to create your own code for technical analysis tools, MT4 also includes access to the MQL4 community, which lets you share and/or download the tools, signals, and scripts or simply share strategies.</p>
<p>It is also possible to add technical analysis tools to MT4 without any use of MQL by downloading and saving a tool in the appropriate spot. You can find detailed information on this process in the XTB FAQ section.</p>
<p>MT4 also includes multiple other tools to assist you with trading, including the ability to create price alerts. MetaTrader also provides access to technical tools like Gann-based tools and Fibonacci indicators, as well as your choice of charts, including candlestick, bar, and line. It also has various oscillators and indicators like Stochastic Oscillator, RSI, MACD, and Moving Averages.</p>
<p>XTB also features an economic calendar on its website, as well as within the xStation platform, which the company refers to as a market calendar. As expected, this calendar includes a full listing of all the upcoming and current events that can influence the various markets. You can filter the search results by impact and country, or just view the whole thing.</p>
<p>You can also adjust the calendar view between a day, week, month, or a custom length of time. For each event, you will see the date and time, country, economic indicator, impact, period, current, forecast, and previous period.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22565 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/calendar.jpg" alt="Calendar" width="808" height="495" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/calendar.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/calendar-300x184.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/calendar-768x470.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/calendar-50x31.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/calendar-610x374.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<h2>Market News &amp; Analysis</h2>
<p>You can get market news and analysis directly via the xStation 5 platform with Trader’s Talk. This is a live audio feed right in the platform that lets you hear breaking news for real-time market opportunities.</p>
<p>On the XTB website, you will find an entire section dedicated to Market News. Visiting this page will show you the latest relevant information for markets that can be traded on XTB. You can view the headlines or read the specifics. Each article has a quick summary as well as more in-depth explanation, including charts and graphs where useful.</p>
<p>You will find news as well as analysis on this page. Most of the articles are available to anyone, but some are locked and require a login. Any type of XTB account gets full access to the news and analysis section.</p>
<h2>XTB Education</h2>
<p>To ensure that all clients have the knowledge they need available at their disposal, XTB offers an extensive Education section; this is one of the main navigation tabs on the website. Within the Education section, you can divide the Trading Academy sections up by skill level or topic. The skill levels include Basic, Intermediate, Expert, and Premium.</p>
<p>Basic helps you learn the most important information about the forex market, instruments, and trading platforms and teaches basic trading techniques. Intermediate takes it deeper by teaching fundamental and technical analysis. This is also where clients learn about managing risk and controlling emotions. Expert courses will be available very soon and will focus on advanced tools and techniques, expert trading knowledge, and advanced functions on the XTB platform.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22571 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/education.jpg" alt="XTB Education" width="808" height="563" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/education.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/education-300x209.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/education-768x535.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/education-50x35.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/education-610x425.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>Finally, the Premium section is filled with Premium content and includes tools, tips, and advice from top traders in addition to advanced trading strategies and techniques. You can access most of the educational materials on XTB without logging in or registering, but the Premium section does require you to log in.</p>
<p>If you prefer, you can also browse the courses in the Education section by subject instead of level. This way, you get to choose from an MT4 Tutorial, an xStation Tutorial, an Introduction to CFDs, Fundamental Analysis, or an Introduction to Forex.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Basic category has 27 lessons to choose from and covers topics like using specific platforms in great detail, risk management, an introduction to types of charts, resistance and support, trading the trend, why macroeconomics matters, global sessions, and more. There are 15 Intermediate lessons at the time of writing, including more advanced how-tos on specific platform features, market sentient and positioning, stocks, cryptocurrencies, intermarket correlation, and more.</p>
<p>There is also a useful search feature on the Education page so you can easily find a topic that you wish to learn more about.</p>
<p>Depending on the language and region you choose when viewing the XTB website, you will also notice live webinars. These allow you to connect with XTB’s market experts and learn or review skills from the comfort of your home.</p>
<h2>XTB FAQ Section</h2>
<p>Like most brokers, XTB has a FAQ section, also known as its Knowledge Base. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, the FAQ section does not information on the International Page. It is labeled as “Soon” with categories for Our Platforms, Your Account, and Trading Glossary. While the FAQ section will likely be useful in the future, the lack of content at the moment is a significant disadvantage for XTB over other trading platforms.</p>
<p>Without FAQs in place, the chances of needing to contact customer support to understand a process or resolve a minor issue increases. This may be a hassle for clients and likely also increases the wait times for support as more people contact support for minor issues.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22572 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/faq.jpg" alt="FAQ" width="808" height="555" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/faq.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/faq-300x206.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/faq-768x528.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/faq-50x34.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/faq-610x419.jpg 610w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/faq-235x160.jpg 235w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>In the meantime, we suggest that if you cannot find an FAQ section with information on the XTB website dedicated to your region, that you visit that of another region. The version of XTB targeted towards United Kingdom clients in English, for example, currently has a reasonably detailed FAQ section with a total of 31 categories and 51 topics.</p>
<h2>XTB Affiliate Program<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>XTB offers both an affiliate program and an Introducing Broker (IB) program. With the affiliate program, you get marketing tools from XTB that you can use to advertise on your platform or website.</p>
<p>Visitors get redirected to XTB via a unique link. You can then earn money for successful referrals, doing so on a monthly basis. This method can earn you as much as $600 per trader.</p>
<p>The Introducing Broker program acts as a partnership. You refer your clients to XTB and they open up and account and start trading. You will then receive a commission based on the trading volumes that your clients generate.</p>
<h2>XTB Customer Support</h2>
<p>The client support from XTB is very highly rated, having earned a five-star rating from its clients. Part of this is due to the friendly, prompt service, while another aspect is XTB’s previously mentioned desire to build long-term relationships with its clients. The support team is available 24 hours a day Sunday through Friday. This makes it easy to get help exactly when you need it.</p>
<p>The fact that everyone gets their own personal account manager is also incredibly useful as this allows for personalized service and a simple point of contact.</p>
<h2>Is XTB Safe?<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Since XTB is regulated, you can rest easy knowing that the broker holds all of its retail clients’ funds in a segregated account. This means that those funds never mix with the broker’s own funds. There are also additional measures in place, such as storing the funds in ring-fenced accounts separate from those of XTB. The use of segregated funds for client funds ensures that if something happens to XTB and the broker must file for bankruptcy, the client funds cannot be considered recoverable assets by XTB’s general creditors. Instead, the funds would have to be returned to the clients.</p>
<p>In the case of XTB clients in the United Kingdom who sign up via the UK version of XTB, there is additional fund protection via the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. This scheme, known as FSCS, provides insurance of up to £50,000 per person if the unlikely scenario occurs and XTB becomes insolvent.</p>
<h2>XTB Security</h2>
<p>All personal information that you submit to XTB remains safe with the company. All of the data passes through a secure SSL connection to prevent hackers from gaining access to it. Due to XTB’s regulation and authorization from various financial organizations around the world, you can count on the broker to maintain the highest level of security.</p>

<p>Trading stocks with FXTM is a good way to diversify your portfolio and introduce risk. It also helps not have to deal with the time limits associated with stock CFDs.</p>
<p>To trade stocks with FXTM, you need an FXTM Pro MT5 Account. This will give you spreads from 0 pips, the fastest execution, and your choice of mini, macro, or standard lots.</p>
<h2>ForexTime Trading Terms</h2>
<p>ForexTime prides itself on <a href="/out/fxtm">offering excellent trading terms.</a> There is fast execution and the availability of micro and mini lots.</p>
<p>The minimum deposit is conveniently low and the platform uses No Dealing Desk (NDD) technology. FXTM also has deep interbank liquidity and allows for Expert Advisors as well as Logarithmic Trading.</p>
<p>Floating leverage can be as high as 1:1,000. Spreads can be as tight as 0.1 pips depending on the market conditions and account type.</p>
<p>The leverage of up to 1:1,000 is part of the FXTM floating leverage system. With that high leverage, traders are able to increase their potential profits via trading larger volumes. This does, however, come with a higher risk.</p>
<div class="risker">Disclaimer about leverage: Leverage is offered based on your knowledge and experience. The Leverage / Margin requirements may be subject to change as a result of applicable regulations in your country of residence.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22588 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/leverage-1.jpg" alt="FXTM Leverage" width="808" height="564" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/leverage-1.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/leverage-1-300x209.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/leverage-1-768x536.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/leverage-1-50x35.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/leverage-1-610x426.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>The tight spreads from ForexTime help to ensure that traders can take advantage of low initial trading costs.</p>
<p>FXTM also delivers fast execution as transactions are executed immediately. This means that you do not have to worry about delays interfering with your ability to get the best prices.</p>
<p>The NDD technology mentioned lets ForexTime work with various liquidity providers. That gives the clients the best possible prices for both bid and ask. This tech provides deep interbank liquidity. It also provides the ability to deliver those previously mentioned instant trades.</p>
<p>To view the full contract specifications for all trading instruments, go to the Trading Instruments portion of the ForexTime website. Then, visit Contract Specifications.</p>
<p>You can view specific information for forex, spot metals, CFD US shares, spot commodities, stock trading, spot indices. You will see information such as minimum or typical spreads, pip values, swaps, and trading sessions.</p>
<h2>ForexTime Margin &amp; Leverage</h2>
<p>You can view every single one of the margin and leverage requirements for ForexTime trades <a href="/out/fxtm">on the appropriate page</a> on the broker’s website. All the info is under the main category of Trading Accounts.</p>
<p>The margin requirements and leverage requirements are listed for Standard, ECN, and ECN Zero Trading Accounts. View the requirements in the categories of FX majors, FX minors, FX exotics, spot metals, BTCUSD, ETHUSD, LTCUSD, and RPLUSD.</p>
<p>For each of these, you can find the notional value for USD, EUR, GBP, or NGN, as well as the leverage offered and floating margin as a percent.</p>
<p>The same information is displayed below this with the information for FXTM Pro MT4 Trading Accounts. Then, for FXTM Pro MT5 Trading Accounts as well.</p>
<h2>FXTM Comissions</h2>
<p>The commissions charged by FXTM vary based on account type. There is no commission on Standard Accounts, Cent Accounts, Shares Accounts, ECN Zero Accounts, or FXTM Pro Accounts. ECN Accounts have commissions of $2 per lot.</p>
<p>In the case of certain accounts, there are floating commissions. For ECN MT4, for example, the commission depends on the trading volume and equity, with lower commissions corresponding to higher trading volumes and equities.</p>
<p>You can view the specific floating commission rates under Trading Accounts on the Commissions page. You will also find commissions for stock trading via PRO MT5 here.</p>

<p>At the same time, it lets successful traders make money from their success by letting others copy their trades.</p>
<p><a href="/out/fxtm"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22593 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fxtm-invest.jpg" alt="FXTM Invest" width="808" height="640" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fxtm-invest.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fxtm-invest-300x238.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fxtm-invest-768x608.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fxtm-invest-50x40.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fxtm-invest-610x483.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></a></p>
<p>Part of the FXTM Invest program is the inclusion of a list of the top-ranking strategy managers. This information has been verified by an audit. For each Strategy Manager in the program, you can view detailed information to help you decide.</p>
<p>This includes a profitability chart, the Strategy Manager, the return, the week’s return, and the max drawdown. It also includes the risk level, the days open, and the profit share in percentage.</p>
<p>Each Strategy also has a rating out of five stars to help you make your decision. You can view the Strategies by only looking at those that are top ranked or all of them.</p>
<p>Clicking on any of the Strategy Accounts will show you its rank, the number of investors, the days open, the risk level, the return. It will also show you specific figures for the day and month.</p>
<p>There is also a section where the Strategy Manager tells you about the Strategy and any other additional relevant information. Below this, you will find charts and graphs detailing returns and monthly statistics by trades.</p>
<p>Below this are general statistics, including total trades, profitable (and unprofitable) trades by percent, average trade length, consecutive wins. Additionally, there are statistics on the greatest win in pips, average daily trades, deals with stop loss, deals with take profits.</p>

<p>Overall, FXTM Invest gives those looking to engage in copy trading all the information they need to decide which Strategy Manager or Strategy Account to copy.</p>
<h2>Automated Trading</h2>
<p>FXTM allows for Logarithmic Trading and Expert Advisors. The algorithmic trading is automated trading, which provides a great deal of convenience for traders who are busy.</p>
<p>This method lets ForexTime clients create their trading strategy or choose the strategy of someone else. They can then use an automated trading system, such as Expert Advisors, to follow the trading strategy.</p>
<p>The system will automatically trade for clients based on the strategy you implement.</p>
<p>Many traders appreciate the fact that automated trading ensures you do not miss any opportunities if you cannot watch the markets 24/7.</p>
<p>FXTM offers this since it makes it possible to make a profit even when asleep. Of course, automated trading can lead to losses as well as profits, as everything depends on your strategy and the market.</p>
<h2>Trading Restrictions</h2>

<h2>FXTM Trading Platforms</h2>
<p>Those with <a href="/out/fxtm">ForexTime accounts</a> can use MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5. This compatibility with the top forex trading platform eliminates the learning curve for those who switch to FXTM from another broker.</p>
<p>It also means that there is a wealth of resources and tutorials available, both from ForexTime and other sources. Of course, that also means that traders get all the great features of the MetaTrader platforms.</p>
<p>Those who prefer to trade on the go will also appreciate the support for applications for tablets and mobile devices.</p>
<p><a href="/out/fxtm"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22595 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fxtm-trading-platform.jpg" alt="FXTM Trading Platforms" width="808" height="694" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fxtm-trading-platform.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fxtm-trading-platform-300x258.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fxtm-trading-platform-768x660.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fxtm-trading-platform-50x43.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fxtm-trading-platform-610x524.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></a></p>

<p>Like MT5, MT4 is available for nearly every device you can think of. You can learn more about or download the versions for PC, iOS, Android, Mac, WebTrader, or Multi Terminal via the ForexTime website.</p>
<p>One very useful part of the ForexTime website is a comparison between MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5. That way, clients can choose which platform from MetaQuotes will work best with their FXTM trading experience.</p>
<p>The comparison includes the key differences, including order execution types, partial order filling policies, order filling policies, pending order types, and hedging.</p>
<p>It also includes netting, market depth, technical indicators, timeframes, graphical objects, email systems, economic calendars, strategy testers, and the embedded MQL5.community chat.</p>

<h2>ForexTime Performance Statistics</h2>
<p>FXTM shares its performance statistics on its website to deliver transparency and show potential clients what they can expect from the broker.</p>
<p>FXTM verifies all of its performance statistics before publishing them. That verification is done with PricewaterhouseCoopers Limited (PwC). This is in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000.</p>
<p>According to ForexTime, the company publishes all these statistics to reset the benchmarks and standards of the forex industry. Also, to improve transparency and to enhance awareness.</p>
<p>In terms of statistics related to clients and customer service, the average wait time is less than 12 minutes. More than 84 percent of client funds are processed within just five minutes. FXTM receives feedback that is more than 90 percent positive.</p>
<p>You can also view graphs on the FXTM Performance Statistics webpage that display the order execution speed, slippage, and requotes.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, each of these graphs displays the statistics for each month of 2018. Order execution speeds are lowest for Pro trades, which get as low as 0.050.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22597 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/order-execution-speed.jpg" alt="Order Execution Speed" width="808" height="476" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/order-execution-speed.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/order-execution-speed-300x177.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/order-execution-speed-768x452.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/order-execution-speed-50x29.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/order-execution-speed-610x359.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>The slippage graph shows that most FXTM clients get to take advantage of positive slippage while enjoying reduced negative slippage. In 2018, positive slippage got as high as 85.82 percent in March. Negative slippage got as low as 14.18 percent in the same month.</p>
<p>Looking at the requotes, you see that ForexTime has a competitively low rate that the company is striving to improve. The requote rates in 2018 never averaged above 2.08 percent and got as low as 1.51 percent.</p>
<p>To supplement these performance statistics, ForexTime lets traders connect with a Strategy Manager to copy their trades via FXTM Invest. To assist with the decision, ForexTime displays the live rankings for top performers, with all the data verified by PwC.</p>

<p>FXTM clients can trade via MetaTrader 4, MetaTrader 5, or the FXTM Trader application for mobile devices.</p>
<p>FXTM offers a range of different account options to suit most types of traders from beginners to pro, each has different pros and cons so make sure you take time to look at what each offers.</p>

<p>There is a good range of instruments to trade including the usual Forex and shares option.</p>
<p>FXTM invest is an interesting addition for copy trading ( this isn&#8217;t available in the UK though) which not a lot of brokers, <a href="https://blockonomi.com/etoro-review/">apart from eToro</a>, include in their offering. This allows you to invest in a trader of your choosing and take a share of any profits they manage to generate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you interested in the biggest, most liquid markets there is?</p>
<p>The <strong>FOREX</strong> market, or <strong>FOR</strong>eign <strong>EX</strong>change market, has a daily turnover of more than $3 trillion USD.

<p>Many people are attracted to the FOREX market because they think it is possible to make a lot of money very quickly, and to some degree, this is true. The amount of &#8216;leverage&#8217; that FOREX brokers will let their clients use is unmatched, but using huge amounts of borrowed money is a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>While there are FOREX brokers that are well regulated, there are also an enormous number that aren&#8217;t located in developed nations, and operate outside of any regulation or law. Before you start trading FOREX, or give away your personal information to a &#8216;broker&#8217;, it is a good idea to learn a little bit more about the industry.</p>

<h2>What is FOREX Trading?</h2>
<p>At its most basic level, FOREX trading is speculating on the value of global currencies.</p>
<p>The biggest players in the FOREX market are money center banks and central banks, like the Federal Reserve in the USA, or banks like Barclays. For bigger financial entities, the FOREX market is a way to move money from one country to another.</p>
<p>A bank also may need to hedge their exposure to a foreign currency or help one of their clients do the same thing. While this is part of what the FOREX markets do, there is also a lot of speculation by major investors and trading desks at big banks and hedge funds.</p>
<p>Unlike equity or debt markets, FOREX markets operate via contracts that rely on the price difference between two currencies to have value. These derivative contracts are how FOREX trading happens, no matter how big or small.</p>
<p>For example, a trader may want to gain exposure to the US Dollar, but that must happen as a result of the US Dollar appreciating against another currency. The most liquid currency pair on the planet is the US Dollar/Euro, which is abbreviated with the currencies&#8217; ISO codes as &#8216;USDEUR&#8217;.</p>
<p>Major banks and hedge funds often buy FOREX contracts that will deliver the currency to their account. Most retail FOREX brokers don&#8217;t offer this kind of derivative contract and are designed for currency speculating.</p>

<h2>How Does FOREX Trading Work?</h2>
<p>For the individual FOREX speculator, trading usually involves the use of borrowed money, or &#8216;leverage&#8217;. Depending on what FOREX broker you choose to use, the amount of leverage can range from 2 or 3 times (2x or 3x) the money you have deposited, up to 500x depending on the regulations.</p>
<p>Regardless of the leverage, a FOREX trade starts by either buying or selling a currency pair. The currency pair will be quoted with a selling and buying price, for example:</p>
<p>EURUSD 1.3415/1.3418</p>
<p>The selling price is almost always given before the buying price, but it is a good idea to make sure.</p>
<p>In any event, the selling price will always be lower than the buying price. Once you decide which way you are going to trade the currency pair, you will either buy or sell it at the prevailing market price (assuming you don&#8217;t use a limit order, but more on that later).</p>
<p>In this example will assume that you decided to buy the pair at 1.3418.</p>
<h3>Welcome to the Wonderful World of Pips</h3>
<p>The classic lot size in the world of FOREX trading is 100,000 units for most major currencies. That means that when you opened the trade described above, you bought a contract that will track the performance of 100,000 Euros against the market value of the US Dollar.</p>
<p>Today, there are many brokers that use smaller lot sizes. However, for this example, we will use the classic lot size of 100,000.</p>
<p>Instead of being denominated in currency units, like shares, or an interest rate, like bonds, FOREX contracts are denominated in &#8216;Pips&#8217;.</p>
<p>For the 100,000 Euros that are the basis of our example trade, one pip would be equal to 0.0001/1.3418, or 0.00007452675. That tiny number is then multiplied by 100,000 (the lot size) to arrive at 7.45 Euros, which is the value of a pip in this example.</p>
<p>In plain English, for every digit up or down in the fourth position from the decimal point moves (0.000X), the value of the contract will change by 7.45 Euros. It isn&#8217;t hard to see how loads of money could be made or lost in the FOREX markets, and why there are so many brokers out there!</p>
<h2>FOREX Market Regulations</h2>
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is responsible for regulating FOREX brokers, and it is a very good idea to limit your choice of brokers to firms that are fully regulated here in the UK.</p>
<p>There are some brokers that are regulated in other responsible jurisdictions (like the US or Australia), though every country will have some variances when it comes to the rules and how they are enforced. Using an unregulated broker is generally legal, but it can be dangerous, as the broker will be operating with little, if any, oversight.</p>
<p>The FCA has an extensive set of rules for FOREX brokers. Any FOREX broker in the UK must be fully licensed by the FCA, and will fall into one of three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dealer License </strong>Any broker that holds a Dealer License from the FCA can engage in market making activities, and can also hold client funds along the regulations set forth by the FCA. It can also run a &#8216;B-book&#8217;, which allows the broker to act as its client&#8217;s counterparty, instead of brokering the trade on the open market.</li>
<li><strong>Intermediary License </strong>An intermediary license from the FCA will allow a broker to operate a &#8216;matched-principle&#8217; model brokerage that is limited to Straight-Through-Processing (STP) of orders. The difference between a market-making and STP of orders will be covered below.</li>
<li><strong>Restricted Broker License </strong>A broker with this license can act as an marketer for FOREX brokers, but can&#8217;t hold client funds. This class of broker is more like an intermediary between retail clients and brokers that handle trades, more than a &#8216;broker&#8217; in the normal sense of the word.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Every Class of Broker is Different</h2>
<p>Any broker that holds a Dealer License or Intermediary License could also issue and trade in Contracts for Difference (CFDs), whereas a broker with a Restricted Broker License could market the services of a broker who has a wider range of trading instruments.</p>
<p>The capital requirements for all three classes of dealers are also different and may change in a post BREXIT world. For now, to hold a dealer license the minimum capital requirement is EUR 730,000. An Intermediary License holder will need EUR 125,000, and a Restricted Broker License, requires EUR 50,000.</p>
<p>FOREX brokers that are regulated by the FCA will have have to demonstrate that their &#8220;mind and control&#8221; is in the UK, and this means a physical presence and staff on the ground. The Compliance Officer and Chief Executive Officer have to be in the UK, and both will have to pass tests to ensure their competency.</p>
<p>The process for becoming an FCA regulated FOREX broker is no walk-in-the-park, which is why it is worth shortlisting brokers who are willing to comply with FCA regulations.</p>

<h2>Best Copy Trading Brokers</h2>
<p>Some brokers offer a featured called copy trading or social trading, which allows you to &#8220;copy&#8221; another member&#8217;s trades. Thanks to the progression of trading platforms and the spread of social media, more and more brokers are now building this feature into their sites.</p>
<p>The idea is simple and quite brilliant, you can sign up to follow or copy a certain trader and your trades will mirror theirs. The stand out broker who pioneered this concept is <a href="https://blockonomi.com/out/etoro">eToro</a>.</p>

<h2>Risks Involved in FOREX Trading</h2>
<p>Highly-leveraged retail FOREX trading isn&#8217;t inherently risky in the same way that driving F1 cars professionally isn&#8217;t inherently risky. Regulated FOREX brokerages are required to report how many of their clients lose money on their platform, and most are well above 75%!</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why retail FOREX trading can be extremely dangerous for your fiscal health. Using high amounts of leverage is probably the most prominent reason, but the difficulties connected with trading macroeconomics directly are also pretty substantial.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t go into the FOREX market blind, do your homework and learn as much as you can!</p>
<h2>Understanding How Leverage Works</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to the example trade of a standard lot of 100,000 EURUSD bought at 1.3418. If the position was bought in cash, there would be no leverage, and you could theoretically hold the position for as long as you would like.</p>
<p>For that matter, you could just buy 100,000 Euros and park them in a German bank account, and wait for the US Dollar to fall (then send the cash back to the US). This approach is seldom the case with retail FOREX trading. Instead, traders use borrowed money to buy a contract.</p>
<p>In this example, let&#8217;s say that you used 100x leverage to buy the contract. That means that you used 1,000 Euros to buy a contract that is worth 100,000 Euros. As we established above, one pip would be worth 7.45 Euros, which means that a movement from the purchase level of 1.3418 to 1.3315 would result of a loss of 748 Euros (or more than 70% of the money you started with).</p>
<p>In some cases, brokers will allow the use of 500x leverage, which would mean that the loss in the above example would be 5x higher, or 3,725 Euros (or more than 3.7x the money you started with). In most cases, a broker would force you to sell your position if your losses exceed the value of the account.</p>
<p>Depending on how the market is trading, you may end up owing your broker money, because it had to sell the position at a lower level to close it out as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>The Manic Macro Environment</h2>
<p>There is no shortage of factors that can move exchange rates on a daily basis. Depending on the strategy that a FOREX trader uses, data could make a huge impact on how the market trades. If something unexpected happens in the geopolitical environment, that can also make exchange rates jump in unknown directions.</p>
<p>Ultra short-term FOREX traders (scalpers) are more or less immune from the macro factors that affect medium-term traders. In fact, some scalpers use the release of market data to make their trades.</p>
<p>The takeaway from all this should be that using loads of leverage to trade in a market that is extremely unpredictable is very risky. Not only can you lose all the money in your brokerage account, but you can also end up owing your broker loads of money you may not have.</p>
<h2>Common Trading Platforms &amp; Software</h2>
<p>There are a few industry standard trading platforms for the FOREX market, and some brokers have also created their own platforms that get great reviews. The vast majority of platforms will look and feel like Meta Trader 4 (MT4), which was the go-to platform for decades.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MT4 </strong>Meta Trader 4 was released back in 2005 by Metaquotes Software, and has become the most widely used (or copied) FOREX trading platform there is. As a result of its popularity, there are countless programs that have been designed to work with MT4. Some create trading signals, and others are trading bots that make trades based on algorithmic models.</li>
<li><strong>MT5 </strong>Meta Trader 5 was created to be the successor to MT4, but it hasn&#8217;t been the knock-down success that many thought it would be. While MT5 does offer some features that MT4 lacks, many of the third-party programs made for MT4 won&#8217;t work with MT5. Most major FOREX brokers will allow you to choose which platform you want, and there really isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all solution.</li>
<li><strong>Currenex </strong>Currenex isn&#8217;t going to be a good fit for smaller retail traders. Instead of dealing with your broker, Currenex connects you with market liquidity providers (full ECN), and usually requires $20,000 USD to start using the platform. On the plus side, you will be getting the actual market rates for currency pairs, which is attractive for bigger traders.</li>
<li><strong>Proprietary Platforms </strong>Many of the larger FOREX brokers have created their own trading platforms or advanced options that work with MT4. Each one of these platforms will be different, and your broker will be able to explain the different trading platform options you can use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Brokers Make Money</h2>
<p>Every single FOREX broker is going to have a different way of doing business. Some may offer zero fee trading and make their money from the spreads (more info below), while others will charge a flat fee per trade, and offer tighter spreads.</p>
<p>It is a very good idea to learn about which kind of FOREX trading strategy fits your goals before you decide on a broker. Some brokers have special account types for scalpers, while others ban the practice outright!.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fees &amp; Spreads </strong>There is no way to give a comprehensive description of all the ways that brokers apply fees to FOREX trading. We will concentrate on some of the most important terms, so you can sort through a broker&#8217;s fee structure before choosing to give them your business.</li>
<li><strong>Spread </strong>The spread refers to the difference between the bid and ask price for a FOREX contract. In the example used earlier, the price was quoted as: EURUSD 1.3415/1.3418 The spread between the two prices is 3 pips, which would have a value of EUR 22.35 on a standard lot of 100,000 Euros. In a practical sense, the spread determines the value of your contract, which is important to keep an eye on. If the spread widens substantially, it could force a margin call from your broker. Every broker will have different policies on how margin calls work, but it is important to understand that when spreads widen, you could be in for some trouble. Low market liquidity or major events can cause spreads to widen, and the only way to protect yourself is to use smaller amounts of leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Broker Fees </strong>Every FOREX broker will have a fee structure, and it may vary based on the account type you select to use. There are four main ways that FOREX brokers make their money:</li>
<li><strong>Trading Fees </strong>Much in the same way that a stockbroker will charge a client when they buy or sell a share, a FOREX broker can charge you when you open or close a position. Some may have trading fees that are based on the lot size, while others may offer flat fees regardless of how much you buy.</li>
<li><strong>Spread Markups </strong>One of the ways that FOREX brokers offer &#8216;zero fee&#8217; accounts is by using larger than normal spreads to make money. If the broker is able to buy the EURUSD contract at 1.3417 and sell it to you at 1.3418, they will make money. Many brokers offer accounts for new FOREX traders that use this system, as it is far more simple.</li>
<li><strong>Financing </strong>If you plan to hold on to a leveraged position for more than a single trading day, your broker will charge you interest on the money that you are borrowing to keep the position open. The amount a broker will charge varies, but it is generally in the single digits on an annual basis.</li>
<li><strong>Commissions </strong>Instead of charging a flat fee for FOREX trades, some brokers use a commission-based model to make money. The client will pay a small percentage of their trades, usually measured in basis points, to the broker. Be sure to talk to your broker before you start trading so you understand all the additional fees that you will have to pay!</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to Look For in a Broker</h2>
<p>Every FOREX trader will have different needs from their broker. One of the most important things to do is decide on how you want to trade the FOREX market and base your choice in broker on your trading habits.</p>
<p>Clearly, you will also need to know that you are doing business with a reputable broker that will treat you fairly, and pay you when you ask to withdrawal money. Some brokers will charge you when you deposit or withdrawal money, and this is important to consider.</p>
<p>If you plan on making weekly contributions to your trading account, a broker that makes you pay to deposit funds isn&#8217;t going to be a good fit!</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that there are many unscrupulous operators in the online FOREX industry. Some will refuse to allow you to withdraw money, and other operations are designed to steal your identity and financial information outright.</p>
<p>Dealing with a broker who is regulated by the FSA basically removes these risks. That is why regulation is so important, especially in an industry which has seen an influx of bad actors over the last decade.</p>
<h2>Account Types / Demo Accounts</h2>
<p>Today, major FOREX brokers will have some sort of multi-tiered system for client accounts. There is generally an account that is aimed at smaller traders, or people who are just starting out in FOREX trading. These lower-level accounts generally have &#8216;zero-fee&#8217; models which make money from marking up the spread or dealing directly with the broker.</p>
<p>There are two different ways to trade in FOREX. One is called ECN (Electronic Communication Network) trading, and this means that you are actually dealing with a counterparty that isn&#8217;t your broker.</p>
<p>The other form is called &#8216;market-maker&#8217; trading, and this means that you are trading directly with your broker. In other words, if you make money, your broker loses it. There is a substantial debate about how honest market-makers really are. If you are dealing with a regulated broker, and there is an issue, you have some legal recourse.</p>
<p>In any event, every broker listed below will allow you to open up a demo account before you start trading with your real money. Some brokers will let you demo its platform for months, while others will give you as little as a week.</p>
<p>Even if you have loads of experience trading FOREX, it is a good idea to use the demo account for a little while, and make sure you understand how everything works!</p>
<h2>Order Types and Execution</h2>
<p>When you are ready to trade, you will have a few different options in how you buy or sell a FOREX contract. The simplest way to trade is to use market orders, which the broker will fill at the current market prices.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the market prices may change before the broker can fill your order and that the price you pay can change.</p>
<p>If you need to be sure your order is being filled at a certain price, you can use limit orders to try and buy or sell a contract at a given level. All you have to do is tell the broker what level you would like to buy or sell the contract at, and if the market moves to that level, it will be executed.</p>
<p>One of the most important orders there is in FOREX trading is the STOP LOSS order.</p>
<p>A stop loss order allows you to set a predetermined level at which your trade will be closed. This will make sure you don&#8217;t lose more money than you can afford to do without, or get caught pumping money into margin calls for a trade that will end up eating you alive.</p>
<p>The TAKE PROFIT order is the positive opposite of the STOP LOSS order, and lets you sell your winning position at a given level of your choosing.</p>
<h2>Customer Service</h2>
<p>FOREX firms have mixed reputations in the area of customer service.</p>
<p>Many FOREX brokers have only been around for a few years, and their turnover of clients is generally high. Once someone loses all their money in a single trade, they rarely come back for more.</p>
<p>Some of the bigger firms tend to deliver great service to their larger clients, while smaller accounts will struggle with getting their complaints heard. There are numerous things that can affect the FOREX market, and the broker may not be able to control all of them.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using an ECN broker, and the spreads widen after an economic announcement was made, the market action is beyond the control of the broker. It is important to get a feel for what a FOREX broker can and can&#8217;t do, before reading the huge number of FOREX broker reviews online.</p>
<p>Again, we highly recommend you limit your choices to brokers that are regulated by the FCA, or a similar authority in an established jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Statistically speaking, the vast majority of FOREX traders will lose money in the market. Part of this has to do with what actually drives FOREX market movements, and part of it is the eye-watering amount of leverage that retail investors are offered by many FOREX brokers.</p>
<p>Over the last two decades, there have been numerous new FOREX brokers entering the marketplace, which has democratized FOREX trading to a much greater degree than ever before. Some brokers will allow you to start trading with as little as $50 USD in your account, which can then be leveraged up to as much as $25,000 if 500x leverage is permitted by the regulator.</p>
<p>The 20% (approximately) of the FOREX traders that make money probably aren&#8217;t using huge amounts of leverage, and also have years of experience in both macroeconomics and how FOREX markets actually work. The good news is that with smaller account sizes on offer, younger people can get into the market and start learning with far less money than ever before.</p>
<p>If you decide to start trading FOREX, use this article as a starting point for your learning. If you go into the FOREX market with little knowledge, and big expectations for profit, you will probably be unsuccessful.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that when FOREX trading strategies are combined with a high level of geopolitical and economic knowledge, the potential for profit is enormous. That is how George Soros made more than a billion US Dollars in one day when he &#8216;Broke the Bank of England&#8217;!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/out/nordfx">NordFX</a> is a brokerage company that serves clients across the globe and offers a full range of services for online trading. You can use NordFX to trade silver and gold or currencies in the forex market. It also offers the ability to invest in global stocks with a high income and capital protection of up to 100 percent.</p>
<p>NordFX prides itself on offering minimal spreads with immediate order execution. The spreads on major currency pairs are just 0.2 to 2 pips, lower than most competitors. That savings helps increase profits while cutting expenses. Clients can also take advantage of the leverage ratio of up to 1:1,000, which clients can use for both metals and all currency pairs. Accounts, deposits, and withdrawals are all available in USD for ease of use.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="infobutton" href="/out/nordfx">Visit NordFX</a></p>
<p>NordFX began in 2008, and clients have opened more than 1.2 million accounts since then. These clients are spread across more than 100 countries. NordFX&#8217;s parent company is NordFX CY (NFX CAPITAL CY LTD) which is headquartered in Limassol, Cyprus.</p>
<p>Clients will also appreciate the range of assets you can trade with NordFX. There are 33 forex currency pairs, as well as equities investments, Cryptocurrencies and precious metals. The various platforms offer something for all trading styles, including mobile accessibility. NordFX also supplies reliable, stable trading due to the stability of its platforms and servers. Thanks to the servers and platforms, orders are executed in just 0.5 seconds.</p>
<p>It is also very quick to register for an account, with the entire process taking place online for convenience. This means that new clients can start trading nearly right away.</p>
<h2>NordFX Account Types</h2>
<p>There are four types of accounts available from NordFX. All account types give you access to a trading manual and MetaTrader 5. With a Fix account, there are no commissions and the minimum deposit is just $10. The spreads for this type of account start at 2 pips and you can enjoy credit leverage of up to 1:1,000. These accounts can have their balances in USD, BTC, or ETH and have a quote precision of four digits. With this type of account, clients can trade 28 currency pairs as well as gold and silver.</p>
<p>Pro Accounts still have no commission and have the same leverage and account balance currencies. There is a minimum deposit of $50 and the quotes are precise to five digits. The spreads start at just 0.9 pips with this account type. The access to assets is also greater, with 33 currency pairs plus metals and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18825 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/account-signup.jpg" alt="NordFX Account Signup" width="808" height="585" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/account-signup.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/account-signup-300x217.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/account-signup-768x556.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/account-signup-50x36.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>The Zero Account is ideal for traders who want the lowest possible spreads as spreads go from 0.0 pips. There is a minimum deposit of $100 and there is a commission of 0.0045 percent per trade on each side. You have the same three account balance currencies and leverage with access to 33 currency pairs, cryptocurrencies, and metals.</p>
<p>Finally, NordFX offers a Crypto Account with a minimum deposit of $1 and spreads from one pip. The accounts can be in USD, BTC, or ETH and there is access to 16 cryptocurrency pairs plus four cryptocurrency indices. There are maker fees of -0.02 percent (paid to the trader) and taker fees of 0.09 percent.</p>
<h2>Account Verification Requirements</h2>
<p>In general, NordFX does not require any documents to register an account. Even so, it is sometimes necessary to supply documents to verify an account. If this is the case, you will need to submit scans of a photo ID as well as proof of residence, with the information on those documents matching the information on your trading account registration. You will need to verify your account if you plan to use your bank card to make your deposit.</p>
<h2>NordFX Demo Accounts</h2>
<p>NordFX does offer a free demo account without any expiration date. The lack of expiration date is nice since many other brokers limit the amount of time that traders can use a demo account. The only thing to keep in mind is that if your demo account is inactive for more than 14 days, it gets automatically deleted. You can easily create a demo account via MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5 or in the Trader’s Office for your live account.</p>
<h2>Viewing the Trader’s Office</h2>
<p>The Trader’s Office is where you will find your account information on NordFX. You will see it when you log into your account. If you go to the Personal Settings section of the Trader’s Office, you will see your personal data as well as key account parameters, including the account type, selected credit leverage, and balance. This is where you can choose to transfer funds to either MT4 or the Trader’s Office. If you do not select an option, the default is crediting the funds to your MT4 balance. For those concerned about security, you can limit the IP addresses from which it is possible to access your Trader’s Office. To do so, enter the IP addresses that are allowed, separating each by a comma, new line, or space.</p>
<h2>NordFX Deposits &amp; Withdrawals<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>To appeal to a range of clients, NordFX offers a range of funding methods. You can fund your account in USD, EUR, or RUB using a bank transfer, which will take three to five business days. Your bank may charge fees for this, but NordFX will not. You can also make an instant deposit via Visa or MasterCard with these three currencies without a commission.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NordFX supports over a dozen online payment systems, all of which are instant. Those without fees include Ngan Luong (in VND), DCPay (in USD or EUR), Fasapay (in USD or IDR), Alipay (in USD or CNY), Yandex.Money (in RUB), Alfa-Click (in RUB), Neteller (in USD), Skrill (in USD or EUR), and QIWI (in RUB). You can deposit USD, EUR, or RUB via WebMoney for a fee of 0.8 percent but not more than $50. You can make Visa or Maestro deposits via Neteller for a fee of 1.75-4.95 percent or 0-4.95 percent, respectively. There is a fee of $0.50 for USD deposits with PayWeb and a commission of 4 percent when depositing THB with PayToday. Finally, you can deposit USD or EUR with Perfect Money, which has a fee of 0.5 percent with premium or verified accounts and 1.99 percent with unverified accounts.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18822 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nordfx-deposits.jpg" alt="NordFX Deposits &amp; Withdrawals" width="808" height="585" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nordfx-deposits.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nordfx-deposits-300x217.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nordfx-deposits-768x556.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nordfx-deposits-50x36.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>Withdrawal methods are nearly identical with a few notable exceptions and a longer transfer period. Withdrawals via bank transfer take three to five business days. Withdrawals via Visa and Mastercard take five to six business days and cost 4 percent plus $7.50. PayToday has instant withdrawals with a commission of 2 percent. The other online payment systems take a business day for withdrawals. QIWI, Neteller, PayWeb, and Ngan Luong do not charge fees, while WebMoney charges the same fee for withdrawals as deposits. Skrill charges 1 percent and Perfect Money charges 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>There is also a final option of withdrawing from your NordFX account as an internal transfer in USD or EUR without a commission. It is instant for consolidated accounts and takes one business day otherwise. Keep in mind that all withdrawals are just processed between 9:00 and 18:00 CET. Withdrawals submitted after this time limit will be completed the following business day and NordFX does not process withdrawals on weekends or holidays.</p>
<p>If for some reason you make a deposit, but the funds do not get credited to your account balance, you can visit the Trader’s Office online and then head to the Lost Transfer Notification section. There, leave a notification that includes the transfer details. The money should arrive in your account within a business day after this. If it does not, you should email the NordFX Finance Department.</p>
<h2>Trading Platforms<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>You will find NordFX traded on MetaTrader 5, MetaTrader 4, iPhone/iPad, Android, and MultiTerminal.</p>

<p>With MT4 MultiTerminal, you can place a buy or sell order, modify an existing order, and close a position either partially or fully. There is also automatic or manual distribution of the required trade volume for every individual account. Of course, this platform also has the expected high levels of security via Advanced Security for safe data transmission.</p>
<p>Some key advantages of the MetaTrader 4 MultiTerminal include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to fully or partially close positions.</li>
<li>Ability to make and change buy and sell orders.</li>
<li>Only carries out operations in the investor’s account, allowing for some supervision of the actions of the manager.</li>
<li>Choice of automatic or manual distribution of the trade volume required for every account individually. (This is done either by letting the program distribute trade volumes automatically based on equity ratios or using algorithms of equal distribution.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that using an MT4 MultiTerminal platform is somewhat challenging for all but advanced traders. As such, NordFX strongly suggests that you read the User Guide for this particular platform before using it and that you first test the program using a demo account. You should also keep in mind that with the MetaTrader 4 MultiTerminal, all of the managed accounts must be on a single server.</p>

<p>To download the Android application, you can visit the Google Play Store, click the download link in the application description on the NordFX website, scan the QR code on this page on your phone, or download it via email.</p>

The applications have full functionality, although the smaller size of your smartphone screen does somewhat limit the ability to view information in a chart in great detail. These applications are, however, incredibly useful for beginner traders who do not want to use complicated strategies. They can also be helpful for advanced traders who have to be away from their computers for a period of time and want to confirm that their trading strategies are going as planned.</p>
<h2>NordFX Managed Investment Products</h2>
<p>NordFX offers Investment Funds as a simple, transparent, and affordable method of investing in shares of leading companies around the world. New investors with limited amounts to invest can also use these funds to take advantage of professional asset management.</p>
<p>The Pro-Industry Fund from NordFX has an expected yield of 27 percent per annum and includes companies like Motorola, Nike, Ferrari, HP Inc, McDonald’s, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, Boeing, and Coca-Cola. This fund has a minimum investment amount of $1,000 USD with an investment period between six months and a year.</p>

These products include guaranteed income and capital protection. You can sort the options by the minimum investment amount and/or the term of investment.</p>
<h2>NordFX Trading Tools</h2>
<p>As with any reputable broker, NordFX offers a range of tools traders to use to help them strategize and make a profit. One of these features is regular analysis and market news, including weekly forecasts for both forex and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there is also an economic calendar that lets traders know which upcoming events may influence the markets. The economic calendar includes the time and date for each event, as well as the title, the currency, the impact, and figures for actual, forecast, and previous. It is also possible to use filters on the economic calendar to better view the events relevant to your trading strategies.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18832 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/economic-calendar.jpg" alt="Economic Calendar" width="808" height="657" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/economic-calendar.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/economic-calendar-300x244.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/economic-calendar-768x624.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/economic-calendar-50x41.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>NordFX traders can use the Trader’s Calculator to calculate their potential profit. You begin by entering your account type, leverage, and currency. From there, the calculator lets you input your trading positions. For each, you indicate the instrument, the position size, and sell or buy. The open and close prices are filled in automatically. Once you press calculate, you will see the calculated price, the pip value, the spread, the swap, the margin, and the profit for each position. At the bottom, there are total calculations that account for all the positions input into the calculator, displaying the total profit and total margin.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18831 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/traders-calculator.jpg" alt="Traders Calculator" width="808" height="597" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/traders-calculator.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/traders-calculator-300x222.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/traders-calculator-768x567.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/traders-calculator-50x37.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>All clients of NordFX also get access to trading signals via MetaQuotes Software Corp. These trading signals are integrated right into the MetaTrader 4 platforms and let traders connect with thousands of different trading signal providers worldwide. Traders can then automatically copy the preferred signals right in their accounts. NordFX also lets clients become signal providers to increase their income. The Signals service has an easy subscription and includes protection against wrong calculations for trading lot sizes as well as excessive deposit loads. It is highly secure for the signals providers and traders and includes transparency for the trading history.</p>
<p>Neither traders nor providers must allow third-party access to balances and accounts; you do not even need your password to subscribe to the Signals. Depending on the chosen signal, it will have a fee or be free of charge. Other than this, using Signals does not increase commissions or spreads and the subscription term is typically one month.</p>
<p>NordFX also works with Fozzy, a hosting provider, to give traders the ability to use a VPS. The Fozzy Forex VPS sits with the NordFX servers and helps traders ensure they experience 24/7 trading worldwide without any interruptions. The price for the forex VPS from Fozzy for NordFX clients is twice cheaper than the standard price, delivering savings. Because Fozzy VPS is right by NordFX trading servers, there is an excellent transfer rate of less than a millisecond, 200 times faster than the exchange rate you get between the NordFX server and your computer. There is also 24/7 uptime with the VPS so expert advisors can trade without interruptions. The service is also simple to use and reliable thanks to daily backups of all the stored data.</p>
<h2>Educational Resources</h2>
<p>NordFX gives traders access to a vast range of educational resources as well. The Learning Center is an online resource that provides traders with the resources they need regardless of their skill levels. The educational information there can help all traders develop skills and get insights for successful trading. There are sections for forex, a glossary, the economic calendar, a Trader’s Guide to Markets, and the ability to test forex robot advisors. Both the forex section and the glossary supply the expected information, detailing what you need to know about the forex market and its basics in the former while the latter includes an extensive list of definitions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18824 aligncenter" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/education-1.jpg" alt="Educational Tools" width="808" height="585" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/education-1.jpg 808w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/education-1-300x217.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/education-1-768x556.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/education-1-50x36.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>
<p>The Trader’s Guide to Markets is especially useful with a range of topics, such as how to start trading with MT4 and MT5, the calculator, articles on various strategies, trading crypto, cryptocurrency strategies, using 1:1,000 leverage, and more.</p>
<p>The section for Testing Forex Robot Advisors looks at some of the more popular robot advisors for forex trading and tests them out. There are a range of advisors tested in this section, including simple to difficult ones and those that are free as well as paid advisors. To expand this section, NordFX also welcomes traders to submit their own results when using some of the robot advisors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>eToro, Currency.com, Plus500 and Trading 212 are among the most popular international trading platforms. Here, we compare these four platforms according to five key parameters.</p>
<h2>eToro</h2>
<p>eToro is an Israeli broker founded in 2006. The platform is known for its social trading functionality (copy trading) and for having a large number of CFD instruments.</p>
<figure id="attachment_37163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37163" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-37163 size-large" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/etoro-review-1024x682.jpg" alt="eToro Review" width="770" height="513" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/etoro-review-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/etoro-review-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/etoro-review-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/etoro-review-50x33.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/etoro-review-270x180.jpg 270w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/etoro-review.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-37163" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://blockonomi.com/etoro-review-2021/">eToro Review</a>: Complete Guide</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="infobutton" href="https://blockonomi.com/out/etororeview">Visit eToro</a></p>
<h4>Deposits and withdrawals</h4>
<p>eToro supports deposits and withdrawals via credit cards, bank transfer, cryptocurrencies, PayPal, Skrill, Neteller, Rapid Transfer, UnionPay, IDEAL, Sofort, Giropay and Rapid Transfer. The minimum amount of opening deposit depends on the country of the client: from $50 for USA and Australia to $10,000 for Israel. After an opening deposit a client may deposit $50 upwards (or $500 upwards in case of bank transfer). No deposit fee is charged.</p>
<p>The withdrawal fee is fixed at $5. The minimum withdrawal amount is $30. If you open a deposit or make a withdrawal in a currency other than USD, you will have to pay upward of 50 pips for currency conversion. Only 10 withdrawal currencies are supported: USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, IDR, RMB, THB, MYR, PHP and VND.</p>
<h4>Tools for trading</h4>
<p>eToro specialises in CFD (contracts for difference) and Forex trading, but users can also trade equities, cryptocurrencies and ETFs without leverage. All index and commodity trades and all leveraged trades are CFDs. In total, there are more than 2,000 instruments on the platform.</p>
<p>Among eToro&#8217;s innovations are CopyTrader (copying other users&#8217; trades) and CopyPortfolio (investing in top traders&#8217; portfolios).</p>
<p>When trading with leverage, the maximum leverage for retail clients in the Forex market is 30x, 10x for commodities, 5x for stocks and 2x for cryptocurrencies. Currency pairs trading is not available for clients from Russia.</p>
<h4>Trading commissions</h4>
<p>Trading in equities (not CFDs) is free and commissions for CFDs are relatively low. However, eToro has relatively high commissions on Forex pairs. The cryptocurrency spread ranges from 0.75 per cent for VTS and up to five per cent for XTZ. There is a small fee for rollover (overnight).</p>
<p>In addition to trading commissions, eToro charges a fee for inactivity: $10 each month if you haven’t  logged in for a year or more.</p>
<h4>Referral programme</h4>
<p>The Refer a Friend programme offers a $50-$100 bonus for each user who joins through a referral link. However, both the client and the referred client must live in one of 44 specific countries. Russia, Ukraine and CIS countries are unfortunately not on the list.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>eToro is supervised by three financial regulators: Cyprus, UK and Australia. Depending on the client&#8217;s country of residence, the account is registered with one of the three subsidiaries and receives the appropriate protection:</p>
<ul>
<li>UK: £85,000</li>
<li>Australia: no deposit insurance</li>
<li>Other countries: €20,000</li>
</ul>
<p>For EU retail clients, there is negative balance protection for forex pairs and CFDs. In addition, all investments (regardless of their country) are protected by an insurance deposit of up to $1m from Lloyd&#8217;s, but only should eToro&#8217;s become bankrupt. The broker can cancel the insurance at any time.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Trading 212</h2>
<p>Trading 212 was launched in Bulgaria, but has now moved its headquarters to London. Trading 212 is the most popular mobile trading app in the UK (15 million downloads), although the tools available are limited compared to other brokers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45337" src="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trading212.jpg" alt="Trading 212" width="785" height="598" srcset="https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trading212.jpg 785w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trading212-300x229.jpg 300w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trading212-768x585.jpg 768w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trading212-50x38.jpg 50w, https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trading212-87x67.jpg 87w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="infobutton" href="https://www.trading212.com/">Visit Trading212</a></p>
<h4>Deposits and withdrawals</h4>
<p>Trading 212 allows deposits and withdrawals from $1 and for bank transfers from $10 with no fees. If you use a currency other than the base currency for your account (usually US dollar and local currency), you will need to pay a conversion fee. The system supports bank cards and transfers, as well as a number of e-wallets (PayPal, Giropay, etc, depending on the country). Withdrawal to your card takes on average one business day.</p>
<h4>Tools for trading</h4>
<p>The broker offers three types of accounts with different sets of available instruments. A CFD account allows you to trade CFDs only. For those registering an investment (Pro) account or ISA account (UK citizens only), stocks, cryptocurrencies and ETFs are available.</p>
<p>The maximum leverage for retail clients is 30x, but the specific leverage for each instrument is different. For Pro accounts, leverage is available up to 500x.</p>
<h4>Trading commissions</h4>
<p>Trading 212 has fairly low commissions on CFD instruments, although they are higher than on eToro. Trading commissions on forex pairs range from medium to quite high. There are no commissions for trading stocks and ETFs, but these instruments are not available to everyone. The total number of instruments on Trading 212 is more than 2,500.</p>
<p>The currency conversion fee is 0.5 per cent. Unlike eToro and Plus500, Trading 212 does not charge for an inactive account.</p>
<h4>Referral programme</h4>
<p>If a new user joins using a client’s referral link and makes a deposit, both the new user and client receive one free share each. The maximum you can get is 20 shares worth no more than $100 each chosen at random. Unfortunately, the programme is available only in 12 countries: UK, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>The broker is regulated in the UK and Cyprus. The same mandatory deposit protection applies as on eToro: £85,000 for UK users and €20,000 for all others. The insurance will protect you only in the case of Trading 212 going bankrupt.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Plus500</h2>

<h4>Trading commissions</h4>
<p>Many transactions on Plus500 are technically free on particular deposits and withdrawals, but with restrictions. Opening and closing positions are also free of charge.
